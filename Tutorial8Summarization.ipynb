His first year in office has been successful but not trouble-free.\\nA number of his cabinet ministers and senior aides have been caught in minor spending scandals. His self-proclaimed feminist credentials have been tested by an appearance at a gender-segregated mosque in Ottawa.\\nHis government has faced repeated questions over a CA$15bn ($11.4bn/Â£9.3bn) deal to sell light-armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia despite fierce criticism from human rights groups.\\nThe Liberals have failed to follow through on an order by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to fix funding disparities for child welfare services on First Nations.\\nIndigenous Canadians are growing increasingly impatient at how long it is taking Mr Trudeau's government to move forward on fixing persistent First Nations problems, from education to water infrastructure.\\nThe federal public service union is threatening to pull out of stalled contract talks.\\nAnd provincial premiers are grumbling openly about a coming federal carbon tax and arguing for more money for healthcare funding.\\nThose bumps in the road have yet to be reflected in Mr Trudeau's polling. He currently holds a 56% approval rating.\\n\"People will cut you a lot more more slack if they just like a person,\" said Mr Bozinoff. \"He has a reservoir of goodwill going into a second year.\"\\nWhile Mr Trudeau promised \"sunny ways\" on election night, he shows flashes of his pugilistic side.\\nHe told the BBC proudly in November that he left his Canadian critics \"in the dust\".\\nIn May, he elbowed a fellow member of Parliament and tugged the arm of another after growing impatient over what was seen as an attempt to slow the course of a vote in the House of Commons.\\nEven before becoming prime minister, he demonstrated a willingness to be politically ruthless.\\nIn 2015, Mr Trudeau permanently expelled two MPs accused of sexual harassment from the Liberal fold. The year before, he removed all Liberal senators from the party caucus to show he was serious about reducing partisanship in the Senate.\\nIt is that part of his temperament that should prove useful as he enters into a more difficult second year.\\nTwo opposition parties - the Conservatives and the New Democrats - will have new leaders in place ready to challenge Mr Trudeau in 2017 as his government faces increasingly difficult policy challenges.\\nHis party has promised to legalize marijuana in 2017, though they still have to figure out how the potential CA$10bn ($7.6bn/Â£ 6.2bn market for pot will be regulated.\\nThe Liberals will have to follow through on the politically divisive promise to change the way Canadians vote in federal elections.\\nAnd Mr Trudeau will have to make decisions on hot-button issues like energy pipelines and anti-terrorism laws.\\n\"He's getting into the type of issues in this second year that are less consensus based,\" Mr Bozinoff said.\"The free ride the liberals have been getting - that will disappear.\"</td>\n",

You could also use `return_tensors='tf'` to get TensorFlow tensors, but our TF dataset pipeline actually uses a NumPy loader internally, which is wrapped at the end with a `tf.data.Dataset`.

The downside of XLA generation, though, is that it doesn't like variable input shapes, because it needs to run a new compilation for each new input shape!

However, generation can be **much** faster if you use XLA, and if you want to generate data in bulk, you should probably use it! If you're using XLA, though, remember that you'll need to do a new XLA compilation for every input size you pass to the model. This means that you should keep your batch size constant, and consider padding inputs to the same length, or using `pad_to_multiple_of` in your tokenizer to reduce the number of different input shapes you pass.
