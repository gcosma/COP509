              "      <td>But despite millions of pounds, initiative after initiative, the strategy remains deeply controversial, virtually impossible to fully assess and, if its critics are right, fatally compromised and incapable of achieving its goals.\\nPrevent is one of the four Ps that make up the government's post 9/11 counter-terrorism strategy, known as Contest: Prepare for attacks, Protect the public, Pursue the attackers and Prevent their radicalisation in the first place.\\nIn the early days of Prevent, Whitehall was divided over what Prevent meant: was it purely about al-Qaeda-inspired extremism or was it about other groups as well?\\nWas it about tackling violence or the underlying ideology?\\nHow could officials work out who they needed to target to get results?\\nMinisters threw cash at Prevent - particularly in the wake of the 2005 London suicide bombings.\\nIn the six years after those attacks, almost Â£80m was spent on 1,000 schemes across 94 local authorities.\\nSecurity officials wanted schemes to prevent young people from following al-Qaeda's world view.\\nBut other officials saw it as a means of funding pet projects on community cohesion.\\nMany groups that received funding knew what they were doing - focusing on theology and countering the politics of extremism.\\nBut others had no idea about radicalisation at all - and some believed it was a myth because they had no expert experience and were suspicious of the message.\\nVery few of the schemes could be assessed to show one way or another whether they worked - officials were often taking the word of the people they were funding.\\nThere were a few total policy disasters along the way.\\nI remember one really angry imam from the north sending me some materials that officials had presented to him as a proposal for citizenship classes for teenagers.\\nLocal people interpreted the materials as implying that al-Qaeda was behind every street corner, working in every mosque.\\nYou can imagine the fury as government was accused of turning every young Muslim into a suspect.\\nIn turn, some local councils resisted a government attempt to impose a target upon them which would order them to do more to combat extremism.\\nThe councils did not oppose the target because they disagreed with the aim - but they were telling Whitehall that the tactics were stigmatising Muslims.\\nSome of the groups with the most insight into al-Qaeda complained they couldn't get around the table because they publicly attacked foreign policy.\\nWhen the coalition came to power, it promised a clean break.\\nAnd one of Prime Minister David Cameron's most important early speeches was a promise to be tough not just on violent extremism - but on the radical \"us and them\" ideas that underpin it.\\nReligiously conservative groups that had been funded in Labour's days were cut off.\\nThey were seen as part of the same ideological family tree as al-Qaeda - even if they themselves argued that bin Laden was the black sheep of the family.\\nBut one of the biggest knocks to Prevent came when it emerged four years ago that CCTV cameras in Muslim areas of Birmingham - 72 of them hidden - were partly funded by Home Office counter-terrorism cash.\\nThe loss of confidence and trust in police was enormous.\\nThere have been, however, some successes.\\nThe most discrete part of the broad Prevent agenda is called Channel.\\nIt is an intensive one-to-one mentoring programme to challenge violent views through deprogramming and rewiring an individual.\\nChannel has turned around some lives - but there will always be some who it cannot help, not least because its resources are limited.\\nPolice forces have a specialist network of Prevent officers - and many of them are trying to work out how to combat the pull of Syria.\\nThe latest scheme is a big push to enlist women to help.\\nOver the weekend Home Secretary Theresa May also proposed changes to the law to tackle extremism and radicalisation in the UK.\\nShe said she was \"looking again\" at banning \"extremist groups\" - something first mooted by Tony Blair in the wake of 7/7.\\nMrs May has also proposed creating a new power similar to anti-social behaviour orders which would restrict the behaviour of extremists who have a role in radicalisation.\\nBut the deputy head of the Muslim Council of Britain, Harun Khan, has told the BBC that Prevent is still alienating the very people government is trying to reach.\\nMr Khan said: \"Most young people are seeing [Prevent] as a target on them and the institutions they associate with.\"\\nSo the real problem with Prevent is this: every time officials try to win trust, they are met with the accusation that they are treating Muslims as a \"suspect community\".\\nSource: Met Police\\nHowever, police chiefs say such accusations are not supported when you look at the successes they have recently had.\\nThere has been a five-fold increase in counter-terror-related arrests in the past six months - the majority of these related to events in Syria.\\nSome of these arrests have come as a result of information provided by the community.\\nAssistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer, says communities are co-operating with the police - but they need more help.\\nNearly half of all the people who have travelled to Syria for a jihadist cause were previously unknown to the security services.\\nThat means extremists who are attempting to radicalise young men and women have been succeeding - and that's why the government's Prevent strategy remains such an important part of the story.</td>\n",

But it will be interesting to watch which Ukrainian politicians will become the focus of her ire.\\nHer politics apparently lean towards the nationalist camp - though how far they extend in this direction remains to be seen.\\nWhile in prison she was elected as a parliamentary deputy from Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party. Both Savchenko and Ms Tymoshenko are strong-willed personalities - and conflicts between them might erupt.\\nBut the biggest question is how she and President Petro Poroshenko will get along. Savchenko voiced her support for the Minsk peace agreements, and Mr Poroshenko looked pleased as he stood beside her.\\nBut she also said that \"peace is only possible through war\". If she decides to turn against the president, the anti-Poroshenko camp will be strengthened by what at the moment is Ukraine's most powerful political voice.\\nReacting to Savchenko's release, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini described it as \"long awaited good news, that the EU celebrates with her country\", while German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said it was \"good news that we have long worked for\".\\nSavchenko was captured in 2014, as pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions battled government forces.\\nShe was charged with directing artillery fire that killed the two journalists, but she says she was kidnapped prior to the attack and handed over the border to the Russian authorities.\\nHer time in jail saw her mount a hunger strike and she was even elected in absentia to Ukraine's parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\\nThe two pardoned Russian nationals flew to Moscow's Vnukovo airport on a specially chartered plane.\\nThey were met by their wives, as well as media representatives.\\nUkraine said the pair were elite members of Russian military intelligence - but Russia insisted they were not on active duty when they were captured in eastern Ukraine.\\nThey were sentenced to 14 years in jail last month after being found guilty of waging an \"aggressive war\" against Ukraine, committing a terrorist act and using weapons to provoke an armed conflict.\\nUkraine and the West had repeatedly called for Savchenko's release and a prisoner swap was long been considered likely.\\n\"It's been a long and complicated road,\" said Nikolai Polozov, one of her lawyers.\\n\"But we have been able to prove that there are no insurmountable tasks and we've managed to free the hostage from the jaws of Mordor,\" he added, referring to the cruel land in the Lord of the Rings saga.\\nSavchenko's capture contributed to the deterioration in Russia-Ukraine relations since 2014.\\nMoscow annexed the Crimea peninsula in March 2014 after an unrecognised referendum on self-determination, and is accused of sending weapons and its regular troops to support the separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\\nMoscow denies this, but admits that Russian \"volunteers\" are fighting with the rebels.</td>\n",

For the first 19 years of my life it was something I definitely took for granted.\"\\nHowever, with practice he is learning new movements more quickly.\\nIan is now dreaming of regaining the full function of both his hands as \"that allows you to be a lot more independent and not have to rely on people for simple day-to-day tasks\".\\nThe study marks a significant moment in the field of using computers to bypass spinal cord injuries.\\nIn 2012, a woman used her own thoughts to control a robotic arm, but now patients can control their own body again.\\nDr Ali Rezai, the neurosurgeon who implanted the brain chip, said: \"We're thrilled that Ian has progressed significantly with this technology.\\n\"This really provides hope, we believe, for many patients in the future as this technology evolves and matures to help people who have disabilities from spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury or stroke to allow them to be more functional and more independent.\"\\nOne of the big challenges for the field will be to turn the spectacular feats in the laboratory into something that can be used in everyday life.\\nThe approach requires surgery and then there are lots of trailing and bulky cables. It also needs a large computer to perform the complex algorithms to read the brain.\\nAlso Ian's movements are not as deft as natural movement, even if they would have been unthinkable immediately after his accident.\\nHowever, the motor cortex has millions of neurons and only a few hundred are being read by the chip. It is hoped improvements in the technology will get closer to restoring true full function.\\nThe approach of electronically bypassing an injury is just one frontier triggering excitement in the field of reversing paralysis.\\nCells taken from a patient's nose have been used to repair a patient's spinal cord.\\nDarek Fidyka, a 40-year-old from Poland, can ride a tricycle after previously being paralysed from the waist down.\\nDr Mark Bacon, from the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: \"It is encouraging to see a number of therapeutic options to restore function being explored clinically, but these clinical forays are in their infancy and largely still remain at the level of proof of concept.\\n\"Recent reports of cell and nerve grafts, this research and numerous trials and studies now point to progress.\\n\"Is it time to accept the bar is now set higher? Should we now measure success when we see changes in clinical practice and these proof of concepts end as standards of care?\\n\"I don't think it is too early or unhelpful to think along such lines, even if this some way off.\"\\nFollow James on Twitter.</td>\n",

        "Then, we need a special kind of data collator, which will not only pad the inputs to the maximum length in the batch, but also the labels. Note that our data collators are designed to work for multiple frameworks, so ensure you set the `return_tensors='np'` argument to get NumPy arrays out - you don't want to accidentally get a load of `torch.Tensor` objects in the middle of your nice TF code! You could also use `return_tensors='tf'` to get TensorFlow tensors, but our TF dataset pipeline actually uses a NumPy loader internally, which is wrapped at the end with a `tf.data.Dataset`. As a result, `np` is usually more reliable and performant when you're using it!\n",

This results in a *huge* speedup - up to 100X! The downside of XLA generation, though, is that it doesn't like variable input shapes, because it needs to run a new compilation for each new input shape! To compensate for that, let's use `pad_to_multiple_of` for the dataset we use for text generation. This will reduce the number of unique input shapes a lot, meaning we can get the benefits of XLA generation with only a few compilations."
