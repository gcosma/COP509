Still having problems getting the upper tension correct. Still too tight. Keep re-threading the machine but haven't found the problem yet.
My craft store was out of this yarn, and I needed more to finish a baby blanket. It is so soft, and fluffy.
The color cup itself works well but I wish there was a statement that it did not include a cover. I would not suggest using it without the cover due to the risk of paint spillage. Overall works as advertised and fit is correct for Anthem 155.
This latch hook is not made the best, the little lever that pulls the yarn through broke after about a week. The ones with the wooden handle are made MUCH better..
Ironically, this glue was intended to be used for shipping labels just like those generated for printing by amazon check out.While I found some stuff I really liked about these sticks, the stuff I don't like in fact the critical dislike, far outweighs the positives.Positives:a) No smell, no flavour, no mess (yes, I sniffed and licked and rubbed the glue stick).b) relatively easy to useNegatives:1) Weak adhesive power, even if both sides daubed (but see note below)2) invisible when applied so difficult to see how much has gone on (might be useful to use the purple disappearing glue but see note above)I changed to this style of glue from traditional elmer's because the latter is a bit messy at times but it sure does stick well.I will use these sticks up, along with scotch tape to ensure the labels stay, but switch to something else asap.I would like to find some rice glue with a brush applicator and will go a searching right here on amazon presently.
This is the first serger I have ever used. I was afraid to thread it but the accompanying dvd and written directions made it easy. I've swapped out the thread and the needles multiple times with very little effort except threading the needles due to space limitations for your hands, but there are tools for that which I am considering. Some of the manual is incorrect but it's easy enough to figure out what they are trying to say. It's a nice compact size so I can have it on the same table as my sewing machine and switch between them easily.
By looking at the picture, I assumed there were more colors, and larger sizes, but I was wrong, and can't use them for what I had in mind.
I knew this product was a good one before i ordered it. I had it shipped next day, but that was on a friday. It arrived the following tuesday. I dont know what else to say. Yes, i was satisfied with the service.
I look at the price now and can't believe I spent that much on it. However, it was money well spent. I use this product to preserve my children's artwork and schoolwork, any letters they write me and newspaper clippings. I have not tried the sticker cartridge or the magnet cartridge, just the laminating cartridge. It does the job beautifully, and I'm glad I have the option of using it to make so many other things with just a quick change of the cartridge.The Xyron 900 is easy to use. Just place the paper and turn the handle. There is a cutter on the other side to cut the laminated product to size. It is a removable cutter, so I can take it out and use it for other purposes, as well, or even to cut the sides of the laminate piece off.This is a terrific way to preserve memories. I'm glad I bought it.
instructions a little weak. trial and error to get it to work.will not work when attaching buttons to heavier material, shorts, jeans. works OK on shirts
I used 12 of the pins to secure a bed ruffle. I put pieces of felt on the box spring first to help prevent the pins from tearing the fabric. We then turned the mattress end-for-end and the bed ruffle stayed in position perfectly. There are enough pins to do another bed. I give them 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the price - $8 is ridiculous for a box of pins.
I recently started a project that required an upholstery needle (12") to attach a button for that 'tufted' pillow look. Let's just say, it didn't go well. These needles are tragically dull and unable to pass through muslin or quilting cotton (which is an impressive failure). With quite a bit of force, and bending the needle in the process, I finally got the needle through, but it just wasn't up to the job in the long run.Maybe I just don't understand upholstery needles, but I was disappointed with these. I don't think I'll be going to these for further upholstery projects.Needless to say, I love every other Dritz product I own.
I bought this at Target yesterday because it was on sale for $99.00 and after a looking at all the other sewing machines this one looked like it would simple enough for me to use. I am a beginner and know nothing about sewing but I'm very good at following directions and reading intstructions. I took it home and took it out of the box it was a beautiful sturdy machine or so I thought. Beautiful yes Sturdy no.I tried thread the needle and was having one hell of a time threading it. You really need very good eye sight. Tried letting the machine do it as the book instructed .. it didn't work. Ok so.... Once I got the thread thru the needle and the bobbin dones as well I decided to take it for a whirl and start sewing.Well both threads got all bunched up. My fault I said must've done something wrong. So I tried again .... once again thread got all bunch up... so I decided to take out the bobbin ( maybe I didnt have it counterclock wise ..when I took out the bobbin the metal parts from where I took out the bobbin came out as well.. I don't know why??? I didn't force out the bobbin!!!So I said Oh to hell with this... I'm not even going to attempt to play mechanic and figure out how those pieces go back together so I closed the lid, placed back in the box and will be returning it to Target and explained to them what happened and get a full refund.I'll probably get a cheaper one that I can learn on. I mean I really thought that this one would be great for a beginner like me seeing that I didn't want one with any bells and whistles but I gotta say I was disappointed.Oh welll.... maybe with my next sewing machine I'll have better luck!!!
The book was very informative and easy to understand. I liked that the authors encouraged the readers to use their own imagination when choosing a photo. I also liked that they gave tips on how to chose the fabric.
I recently bought this item and am a little disappointed with it. I've used it only once and already one blade is broken and I haven't had time to enjoy using it.Can anyone tell me where i can get replacement blades please. I think I might need to buy a few.
This yarn is soft, but strong and because of the larger size, it's super fast to work with. The strands stay together really well, unlike some yarns where you find yourself catching/snagging on half the strand or in places that you don't want to be. One review mentioned a glittery string, and I think that may only be in a few select colors, as mine didn't have that and many of the colors I've seen in stores didn't either. Love it, great for making hats and stuff like that. As one review said, it is probably cheaper to drive to the store and buy it though, if you can find it there.
I received this machine for a Christmas present in 2005. From then until late 2011, I have used the machine occasionally to work on light sewing projects and repairs. I haven't had any issues with jams or threading issues, but my machine recently came to a screeching halt while working on some Roman shades.I assumed it needed a thorough oiling. The manuals specify only one oiling point - in the bobbin case. None of the rest of the machine is meant to be oiled by the owner. I spent an hour trying to find ways of removing the covers to get into it, and was only partially successful at that.I oiled every joint in the machine that I could access. However, the mechanism still did not loosen up. It apparently has sealed joints that are not serviceable.I took the machine to a local repair shop. The repair person told me that the machine was not worth repairing. He said that these machines are low end and designed for a dozen or so sewing projects before they break and need replacing. He said that Singer has been through several changes over the years that have resulted in very degraded quality and mass-market machines being produced and sold.I learned from this that I am far better off with my old Nelco machine from the 1960s which has all-metal parts and is very serviceable.
this paper is thin and somewhat see-through... and a lighter color than the picture shows.
I wanted a pearly white for an accent on a painting. This was perfect. I was thinking that I could use it like an oil pastel---but had to use a brush
This is by far the best tracing material for patterns I have ever used. It is easier to work with it than tradicional tracing paper as it is sturdier and as it is sewable, newbies like me can sew the whole garment and wear it in order to make adjustments or simply test whether we choose the right size.
This machine is really cheaply made. The price speaks for itself. If I had a second chance, I'd use the $30 on this to put in towards a $100 machine or more. No matter what kind of thread you put in the machine, it keeps getting snagged every time you sow. Does NOT sow jeans fabric well, sometimes not even at all!!! And it keeps getting stuck with even the most simple pieces of fabric.Don't buy this machine.
Purchased this to store larger family pictures. It will hold 48 pics, and right now that is plenty. I like how it is acid free and shouldn't damage my photos. However, I was hoping the cover was more hardcover. It is bendable. It reminds me of a 3 ring binder material. It won't stand on its own and if I lay it down, I'll need to lay it flat as it will bend and warp the pictures. The pages are thin and seems not very durable for frequent use, however I am only speculating at this point. For just storing pictures I think it will be fine. Also there is no zipper or other way to keep it closed. Again for what I'm using it for it shouldn't matter but it might be a nice feature to make sure things don't fall out or dust gets in. For the price I feel it is good quality and will fit my needs.
This kit did not come with any instructions how to use the pieces, apparently they expect only jewelers to order them. Needs to be more DIY friendly!
Thanks for the Ghost in the Shell patch. My son-in-law loved it. Thanks for getting it here on time for his birthday! I appreciate it.
I was disappointed with performance of this item as it didn't fully make the shape punch sharply. I ended up with shredded paper. I returned the item, only to receive another puch maker that didn't work either. I returned both items and am still awaiting for proper credit to my account. Overall, I am terribly unsatisfied.
I like this machine and all its functions but the thread was always getting snagged. Also the instructions do not explain that when threading the thread there is a location (the long slit on the picture running from the top to the bottom) where the thread has to be hooked onto a very small unnoticable hook. If you don't mind stopping and fixing these problems every couple of minutes than your fine.
My husband loves this! Still need to get a venting hose before use. &#128515; &#128515; &#128515; &#128515; &#128515; &#128515; &#128515;
The brushes were ok but the largest shed badly and was more trouble than it was worth to use.So I would not recommend this set
These shears have a very comfortable handle, and the blades cut well. I found them a bit difficult to use on heavy flannel until I loosened the screw holding them together to make them easier to use. I was having a struggle with their cutting on this heavy flannel, but they did a nice job afterwards.
I really wish I hadn't bought two boxes of this. It's pretty, but the glossy surface and thickness make it impossible to fold delicately. It's too hard for kids and too frustrating for adults.I've never seen glossy origami paper before. This is probably why.
I purchased this item, because I was looking for a puncher that allows to precisely position and cutout circles with printed elements. Receiving it I liked the design and the way it is handled like pliers/scissors rather than the trandition punchers, that one operates with the thumb. Though I was already worried about the durabilty of the tool, due to the very flexible and weak plastic handles, I appreciated that the punch itself was at least made out of cast iron. After around some 40-50 punches the tool broke. I opened it up and realized that the mechanism transforming the rotational movement of the handles into the translational movement of the puncher uses thin plastic guiders that broke due to the "intense" usage of 40 punches.This could be easily fixed by slightly changing the design and casting the guiders to the frame instead of using the outer plastic casing for guidance. I called up Fiskars hotline and filed a complaint. They sent me a replacement tool at no cost, which I have to point out as good customer service (earning them a second STAR), though the deficit of the device is still present. This tool is not the type of quality that I expect from Fiskars. Unfortunately unless one wants to punch the very thin "Chinese style" paper and only use the puncher about 10 times, I do not recommend this tool.
Don't waste your money or space in the landfill! It's flimsy and doesn't work. I tried to use it to sew and it got stuck right away, ruined the fabric. I wish I could give it no stars, but it won't let me.
These are hard pages to find so was really happy to locate them through Amazon. Haven't worked much w/them yet so hope they are as good as they look!
Despite it's claim that it has a no-drip tip; I'm here to tell you that this sucker drips. As long as a glue stick is in the chamber and the unit is on, it will drip and continue to do so until turned off and allowed to cool. Other than the aforementioned, I like it's duel temp feature and low price. Does not come with any glue sticks :(
I ordered this part for the window on my jeep wrangler TJ which it is supposed to fitI received the part and it is not the same shape or the same size
I am new to embroidery and saw this product in a YouTube video. I have used it several times on various items and it works perfectly!
i am a demo person i use these alot i now have 4 pares of these two for work and two for home
Cute little wooden stamper set! The wooden stamps are very sturdy and perfect for little hands. Fun idea for kids to add designs to their construction paper creations.
These pillowcases look quite beautiful when stitched up, but I wish they came in 100% cotton, not that polyester blend. Also, sometimes the stamping is too heavy and/or will not wash out until many washes later...but on the whole, I have enjoyed stitching these pillowcases.
Immediately upon receiving this item I opened it installed the battery and it did not work. After an hour of trying to repair it, the sewing arm shifted but then stopped and that was it. In addition the machine was missing parts like the rotary wheel. Very poor product.
I purchased the medium block punch, thinking I would have a 1" x 1" square.After receiving the punch, however, I find it is smaller. On the back of the package it says it is "1 cm/.625 inches" . First, I don't think 1 cm equals .625 inches. Second, there is nothing in the descriptions (here or elsewhere that I could find) saying it is 1" across DIAGONALLY. So if anyone is needing a 1" x 1" square, this is not it.Otherwise, the quality of these punches are fair. Not excellent, but they are handy and easy to use.
Very good. Very warm, as well. There was a discrepancy from the yarn and my pattern on what size needles to use. I used a size down from the yarn's suggestion and was fine.
This product I wasn't satisfied with it broke the first month in owning it, it's too flimsy and I was disapointed in this one.
I was not very pleased with this case. The handle looks like its missing a part and there is no cushion on it for ease on lifting.
The eraser is tiny,, I cant believe the price I paid for this.Its 1 inch wide by 1.5 inches long and less than 1/8th of an inch thick.how can they call this large! It should have been 1 $ I would hate to see the small!
The results of the punch are breathtaking. It produces a beautiful and versatile punch that you can use on cards, scrapbooks, etc. I really love the design. Too bad it's so difficult to use successfully.The problem is the ease of operation. It is EXTREMELY difficult to punch. You have to place the punch on the table and press down really hard to succeed in actually punching out the image completely and fully releasing it from the paper. All the little pieces inside the leaf are stuck inside the punch and you have to try to get them out with a pin or something to avoid having them drop into the inside of the punch or clogging up the punch for the next effort. Even so, the chances of getting a usable punched form after all that effort is 50/50. The rest of the time, the perimeter of the leaf doesn't cut all the way through.I know that it isn't just this punch that is defective, the problem is somehow related to the design/workmanship of the punch. I had bought another one from another seller on e-bay and had to return it. That one was even worse than this one. It felt as if there was something blocking the punch part from coming down. That seller had another in stock, I asked her to test it before sending it to me and she told me that it must be from the same batch because the same thing happened. I then ordered this one from Amazon. Not as bad, but still the hardest punch I have ever used. I don't expect it to last long because I know the plastic pusher-thingy is going to give out under the pressure necessary, but I will enjoy it while it lasts.If you want one (like me)--in spite of the drawbacks--get it soon because (I think) the manufacturer has discontinued it (I'm not surprised) and very few are left on the web. (I know. I checked. 90% say "out of stock").
these magnets may be small but they are powerful is sugest wraping them in electrical tape to make sure they dont chip
Very nice punch set they are well made and heavey duty and work great very good deal for the money!!
The PED Basic seemed like an easy fix for downloading embroidery patterns. Unfortunately it took an IT specialist an hour to get the product installed on my computer. After two hours of trying, failing and stress, I learned how to download designs. I like the product now that the process is over.
It's in the title!Great product in great condition and delivered in a timely manner - thank you!Will use Amazon again and again.Amazon usually has what I'm looking for a reasonable price and I appreciate having it available.
This magnifier is decent for the money, but looking through it it seema a touch hazy in the glass. Still an okay product for what it is!
This machine is horrible! Can't even make simple projects without having multiple problems. Instructions are useless too. Buy a nicer machine and save yourself the hassle and fustration.
I did not understand that this ink is designed for pen sketching, or calligraphy! Therefore I incorrectly ordered it thinking it would be appropriate for my Waterman fountain pen. It does not FLOW through a nib, and therefore I goofed in selecting this product.
I bought these for my 11 year old niece for christmas. She wanted hair chalk and all of the products that were made for kids and labeled as &#34;hair chalk&#34; had bad reviews. Not to mention the comparative increase in price and decrease in number or colors and quality. Hair chalking first came about using art chalks like these so I figured, why not give her more color options and a product that (when taught correctly) will be easier to use? So I did my youtube research and on Christmas day I taught her how to use them while giving her some purple streaks in her hair that she absolutely loved.
I followed the instruction to the book to dye deep black a previosly tie dyed cotton slack. The outcome was awful. My slack came out grayish color and not the deep black color I expected.The previous tie dyed color was not dyed over by the deep black color. I tried RIT black powder dye and worked much better by covering the previous color with deep rich black color.I will not use Dylon again.
These are a decent pair of household scissors, but I'm not sure it's all it claims to be. Here are the points I would dispute:- 3 X harder than Stainless Steel; blades stay sharper longer: Well, after cutting cardboard for a kid's project, I wasn't convinced that the blades were still as sharp to cut paper as they were before the cardboard.- Resists the stickiness of tape and glue: NOT TRUE -- I used them to cut labels and the slivers of sticky ends stuck to the blades each and every time!- Lightweight, yet durable enough for any project: Lightweight, YES, but not more durable than Scotch Precision, which I would recommend over this.I would go withScotch Precision Scissor, 8-Inches (1448)as a better product which also comes with the Limited Lifetime Warranty, basically replacing the scissors if they fail in workmanship anytime in the future. If you're willing to spend the shipping and handling fee to return them to the manufacturer rather than just buying a brand new pair, then the warranty is worth having.
This leather hole punch does what it promises. The packaging does not come with instructions for use so it's a little tricky to figure out. To use it, you have to unlock the clasp on the side of the hole punch, then push the dial to the hole size you want. I have not tried the smaller holes but the medium-large holes are working perfectly. Sometimes you have to get it on the other size to get a clean hole, but it's not difficult to do. It could be better, but for the price, it's hard to beat.
I thought the color wheel would have more to it. I thought it was limited for what I needed it for.
This "toy" polishes rocks. It's a wonderful idea, however, they fail to mention on the box you have to leave this thing running for more than 3 WEEKS! No child has that much patience!
I didn't buy this table on Amazon. I got mine at JoAnn's for half price and with an additional coupon, so it is easily worth the $75 I paid for it. Easy to assemble - took me about 45 minutes by myself. The instructions say to make sure the legs that swing out are facing in different directions, but neglect to tell you that they need to swing a certain way. Once I got the top on, I realized mine were backwards and wouldn't fit into the clips that are on the bottom of the table - but it was an easy fix since the table was already upside down. Other reviewers have said that the table is unsteady or moves - well, I'm not dancing on it and I understand that it's not weight bearing so this is not a problem. It is slightly shorter than a standard cardboard cutting board, but I just used a lumber clip from my toolbox to clamp it at one end and let the other end hang down - problem solved. Not having to crawl around on the floor to cut out a pattern motivates me to sew more. All in all, if you can get this table at the right price I recommend it. And for the folks complaining that it is made in China, I hear you and if you can find anything made in the USA then recommend it for us will ya?
Love the purse hanger! It comes in so handy. And when I recently took a trip to the Southwest, I used it constantly and everyone kept asking where I got it and if it was expensive. And I could honestly tell them, no it was not expensive, easily purchased from Amazon and works great (and my purse is really heavy!)
I am not a beginner sewer but I don't do very complicated projects either - (I learned how to sew over 20 yrs ago, but have been sewing inconsistently since then). I will admit I am used to durable Singer sewing machines made in the 70's or earlier.I have made a few simple things on this machine. I have SO much difficulty with any type fabric other than a simple cotton knit. It can't handle fleece or flannel or even thin flannel/vinyl. I've sewn all of these on other machines without any problems.It does have accessory quilting presser foot option for additional purchase. However I'm doubtful that would make any difference.Also, it does jam in reverse (as in it both jams while reversing, AND gets stuck in reverse, unable to return to FWD once it gets going in reverse.The tension is adjustable but it won't hold to the setting I"ve selected (I selected the tension recommended in the manual for the fabric type I'm using).Drop in bobbin system sounds good but hard to get thread under the secret hidden tension spring that they hide under a plastic tongue.Bottom line:can't handle thicker fabricsissues with reversingchinsy plastic casing cracked open on minetension is unreliablebobbin gets jammed (and yes, I threaded it correctly and made sure it went 1) right direction and 2) under the tension springI want to throw it out the window but give it 2 stars because it does have some redeeming qualities:1) portable if you want to take it to class (or carry it to the trashcan!)2) very ergonomic thread cutting system on the L side,3) nifty automatic threader actually works easily4) reliable button holer (that is, if the bobbin will spin.5) great stitch selectionAGAIN, all of the above positives are useless if the tension won't hold or the bobbin won't spin without jamming.
I was searching for a good dye for nylon, the product says it is great. I tried it, did everything it asked, and no good results, poor product.
Easy to use and they do the job but now everytime I wear those jeans the patch is clearly outlined because it is stiffer fabric than the jeans. I can't wear those jeans anymore because they look silly.
Was a bit disappointed when I received the item in the mail. Container holding the charcoal was tin-ny and cheap. I guess the contents themselves (pieces of charcoal, other pencils) were all fine- it's just that the presentation/box it came in was lacking. Also discovered that the outside cardboard and plastic packaging was damaged and partly opened. Made me question how reputable the company was- and why I didn't just go for a more recognizable brand (Faber Castell, Strathmore, etc). Disappointed since I was giving it as a gift. Ended up purchasing another set- post-Christmas, a Prisma-Color collection from Strathmore. The packaging/presentation was much nicer. I guess this set would have been fine- if you were looking to pay less money and didn't need it as a gift.
I never regretted splurging on this cutter, even though I've only needed it a few times. In fact, it's *because* I rarely cut glass that it is so useful. An ordinary cutter requires practice: Too little pressure and the glass won't cut; too much and the cutter wanders. The Toyo Supercutter has a tap wheel that makes a deeper score, plus a delivery system for lubricant. After using a hardware-store cutter to mess up several window panes, I bought the Toyo even though it is designed (and priced) for glassworkers. Every cut has been perfect--no exaggeration. Quality tools are worth it.
I want to learn calligraphy, and I bought this set because its price point is right for a new hobby. Today I cracked open the box for the first time, wanting to use the Medium nib, because I figured that was a good thing to start with. But it wasn't there!! I have two nibs of the same size, both labeled "B" (for Broad?) and one labeled "F" for fine. Does this mean my set was used?? Beware: you get what you pay for.However, to my untrained eye/hand, the pens do seem to work nicely.
. Love this item. Not only organizes your bobbins but you can see what you have at a glance and the bobbins stay tightly in place in the organizer
I've been using Prismacolor Markers for five years now, and I've never needed anything more than them. They're a cheap alternative to Copics, which are better in quality sure, but are much more expensive. There's also a bit more of a color variety for Copics, but Prismas cover the basics.The one thing you learn to hate about them is how badly they bleed. If you're drawing in a sketchbook, unless you want the three pages behind it to be colored as well, you have to place paper beneath it. I've learned that two to three sheets of scrap paper work just fine. The second problem I've ran into with them is that there's a bit of a color difference in both nibs. The broad nib colors a bit darker, and bleeds much heavier than the fine end. But I suppose that's to be expected.If you're on a budget and you just want a set of markers that aren't Crayola, I'd recommend these. If you're a hardcore wannabe Mangaka or Comic Artist, I'd go with the Copics if you can afford them.Myself, I'm a casual artist that draws for fun and nothing else. If you're like me, these will work just fine for you.
Bought this for my wifes birthday. She loves it! You can't go wrong with a Singer. The name has such a strong brand recognition in the industry. I wouldn't have settled for anything less. Price was great. Got it sooner than what the shipping date was expected.
I was hoping this product would have been designed alittle better. I love it for the storage and organization it gives, however the drawers don't seem to stay on the tracks. Every time you pull out a drawer, it falls off the track. Even the slightest movement with the product takes the drawers of its tracks. I would have expected a better product for the money I spent!StacyIndianapolis, In
Although I'm an artist, I don't use pastels. But I bought this box for storing jewelry. It's perfect for small pieces and you can stand your more traditional jewelry box on top of it.
This is a very bad design in paper punch. It is heavy and full of friction. The handle does not move freely. A lot of efforts to move it up and down. The punched paper waste get stuck inside the vertical holes and does not come out on its own. After a few heavy use, we have to take it apart and use shop press to push the paper waste out. To keep the paper from stuck inside the holes, we had to spray WD40 oil lubriacnt to make paper free to move. What a disaster. Absolutely do not recommend anyone to buy this product. I regretted that I kept it too long before I think about returning it.
These are now made in, of course, Communist China like almost everthing else sold in the U.S. except major appliances, land and at least up to now, automobiles. The box is wood, unlike what another reviewer said. They claimed it is made of plastic. The plastic box comes with a different set of knives. I use these knives to fix imperfect mat cuts in the corners when they occur when I cut mats for my photos. The blades are VERY sharp! So if you like Chicom products, add this one to your collection.
I needed a lot of something clay-ish that would have to dry very quickly overnight. This was quite marshmellowy material that still remained a little spongy after 24 hours. It did what I needed it to do for a children's craft but it didn't achieve the hardness I desired.
The set of 9&#34; needles are VERY nicely made. Smooth with not too pointy tips , nice warm feel to them.
My daughter got this for Christmas. We had no idea it takes nearly a month from start to finish to get polished stones, but I suppose it's a good lesson in patience for a 10 year old. It does not say anything on the box about the wait period, or the fact that the noisy tumbler must be running constantly for the entire time. Fortunately, we have a basement where the tumbler is humming away while not disturbing anyone. I recommend placing the tumbler in the box top it comes in, to avoid "traveling" while the motor runs.All in all, the toy is certainly educational, but it takes a LOOOONG time to get results, and is not for folks who live in close quarters.
I bought this machine about a year ago, and was so excited to have my first Serger! Very soon after though the problems began. First I had problems threading the machine with the poor quality tweezers that were included with it. Then, once I did get it threaded the stitching was always off. I would try to adjust the machine, as the video told me too, but I still had no success. A few months later the light bulb burnt out, and the threads kept breaking. And then, just two days ago, the machine jammed, and it bent some of the pieces inside. Now it won't work at all! I talked to a helpful employee at a local store about the problems that I had been having, wondering if I was doing something wrong, and she told me that the White brand of machines was the worst brand I could have purchased, and that I should trash that one and just get a new one. So some advice to all those out there...don't but any White brand machines (I also have a White sewing machine that doesn't work either). The price is attractive, but the repair bills won't be.
I bought this to cut paper and lightweight cardstock. The blade isn't sharp enough to cut either of those. The construction of the product itself is good but the blade is dull and useless. Maybe I got a refurbished item and they didn't tell me or something? Not sure. Disappointed, though.
The color is a really a washed-out black/ dark gray. You get what you paid for. Spend more if you need black paper.
This magnifying glass is totally to little. Its sitting on my shelf, because you really can't use it for nothing. Its not worth the money.
I am new to the world of origami so this is the first set of quality paper I have purchased. Although my earlier sets were easier to fold crisply, this paper has a beautiful weight to it and the 20 pieces of paper with the patterns and gold highlights are stunning. I don't even want to use several, they are so beautiful! They remind me of the breathtaking kimonos you occasionally see in photos.The smaller size is perfect for small projects (I'm working on some crane earrings right now), though I wish this paper came in larger sizes, like a 6" or even an 8" to make boxes.Overall, although it can be a little tricky to work with, this paper will help you achieve gorgeous pieces, and I highly recommend it.
I am not happy with the limited size of the item that i want to copy 9that i can add to the projector). I should have held out for a more expensive model
Being sharpies, I expected a smoother and more accurate marker than these. The tip is really hard, and in two of the five markers it had imperfections that made the trace look shabby. It was really hard to get any nice work done with them. In the end I had to go back to the calligraphy pen to make my wedding signs, because these markers were practically useless.
This compressor is easy to set up, tiny, quiet, and feels very solid. It works great with my Badger airbrush, and the assembly was really easy. It's slightly louder than an aquarium pump, but isn't bad at all. Were I to be working in a room with a closed door, you'd never know it was running (even with the thin walls of my apartment!)
Great price and it feels good, but, I do a lot of intricate work; this airbrush is disappointing. To get the &#34;fine line&#34; the medium must be diluted so much, quality of the line is poor. I am going to convert to number two hardware rather than the number one hardware but that will cause the fine line aspect to be lost.
I have a Low Shank Snap-On Singer Sewing Machine and I thought this would work with it. It doesn't, this seems to be built for an older style machine with the screw on feet.
I started making a list of my concerns with the Brother CS-8150 from day one...many of my 16 complaints already noted by other reviewers. Must say:1. actual MANUAL MISINFORMS - sometimes the pictures tell a different story from the written instructions - so be very careful when following the steps.2. FAULTY PAGE NUMBERS in the index misinform - often the page indicated is not the correct one. And no online manual to ccorrect these dumb mistakes.3. the machine HAS NO ACTUAL WORDS ON THE BUTTONS, or near them,such as "Lift Foot", "Start/Stop", "Reverse" and "Speed" to reduce guess time, and eliminates confusion when user starts panicking over some machine operation.4. AWFUL DISPLAY GRAPHICS can be vastly improved as difficult to see what they refer to, since pictures so badly presented. Finer resolution? Display is SIGN LANGUAGE!5. UNRELIABLE TENSION changes unexpectely needing frequent adjustment. same as bobbin thread gets used up.6. NEEDLE THREADING STOPPED altogether!LASTLY, what an arrogant company not to put a Manual online. Customer service is halfway, incomplete, nontrusting, and non-concerned for us buyers. Amazon provides a means for its buyers to obtain manuals - but Brother says No to that, we don't want to help! I have found with many products - such as answering machines, sound systems, dvd players, etc. - manuals get lost, damaged or outdated. BROTHER INC., take a hint! I phoned BBrother's HQ in Canada and a woman - whose phone attitude was that the customer service call was a bother and nuisance - told me they will only sell me a copy of the manual for $7 and mail it to me for another $6 - no thanks!
I have an 8 year old daughter that just loves the light tracer. She traces everything she can! It works great!
The color is a really a washed-out black/ dark gray. You get what you paid for. Spend more if you need black paper.
We used this to cover tables at our wedding and it was wonderful! We let our guests color on it with crayons and it was definitely a hit. :)
The kit only comes with one packet for each color. It warns that you may stain your clothes. Of course kids are going to get this on their clothes, so unless you plan to wash everything after each use, I wouldn't recommend.
The picture is misleading. The kit did not include as many pieces of glass as pictured; and they were very small pieces. We also did not recieve a flux pen, as listed. The solder & copper foil were not full spools, as pictured, just pieces. Although the videos were good, I question whether the rest of the items were worth the price we paid - I think we could have assembled our own "kit" items for the same or less money.
After a few weeks of use, these scissors seem fine for most of the small daily office jobs that I've used them for. The titanium-bonded blades are very sharp, and you can cut through most soft materials with relative ease. They are particularly good at cutting paper, and they leave a very sharp, well-defined edge when used. The tip is not as precise and pointed as in some other scissors that I've used, but again they for the most part do rather well.The handle is rubberized and for the most part comfortable enough to hold, although I think that it would have been possible to improve the shape of the grip so that it sits more smoothly and naturally in your hand.Since I've only used these scissors for a very short period of time I am not able to comment on how durable they are. If there are any major issues down the road I'll update this review.As an alternative to these scissors I would recommend that you take a look atScotch Precision Scissor, 8-Inches (1448). I've used those for close to two years, and have overall been very impressed with them.
I am very disappointed in what the buttoneer fastening system will do. It will not keep buttons on mens pants. It will put buttons on mens shirts but they do not last but a day or so. If I had known the quality, I would never have purchased this item.DHughes
I bought this model to show at talks I give on space and astronomy and in particular because it was the same scale as the Saturn V I purchased earlier. The model is made of wood and so does not have a lot of very fine detail, however the boosters do have some sort of ribbing attached to show where each section was joined. The finish on the boosters is not quite perfect as there appears to be some small holes in the surface of the timber underneath the painted finish. Overall though I think it would make a great display on the desk at work or in a case at home and recommend buying one.
the blade is very weak, easy to break, sometimes you can find the same product from your local 99 cents store.
great item if you are putting them on a light colored object. Bad for dark colored objects.
I have one of these machines. It works for the most part... It doesn't like sewing through more than 3 layers of almost any fabric and makes a loud knocking sound when it is being taxed. I expect this machine will not last long.It has an incredibly terrible reverse function. Its a button located to the upper right of the needle. It is annoying because it always sews one stich forward and then starts going backwards instead of just sewing backwards. Also the computerized-ness of it is annoying if you are sewing backwards and stop and then decide you want to sew backwards a little further it will not let you. Pressing the button will do nothing until you sew forward again.If I was buying another machine I would either buy a nice vintage machine or at least another brand (juki most likely), possibly with metal gears and no computer inside.
Key was a little smaller than I thought but is perfect look. It will do nicely at Alice in Wonderland party.
What a piece of junk. I bought this at full price a few years ago, but didn't really use it much until recently. It held up for maybe 2-3 months of regular use before the tension adjustment stopped working and it caused everything to pucker. After dealing with that for about a month it started causing the 'bird's nest' issue with the bobbin, and then the reverse button broke. So after multiple hours spent trying to tinker with this piece of junk, I now have a fancy paperweight that sews in reverse only. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE.
This is the only tool I have found that helps to lift the cuts off of the mat without them tearing. I have the tool kit and this spatula is not included in the kit. I rarely use anything in my tool kit but I use the spatula every time I use my Cricut. The stickiness from the mat does get on the tool so be sure to clean it off after each use.
I purchased this machine as a temporary replacement when I broke my Bernina sewing machine. We did not have the funds to spend $500 comparably repairing or replacing the Bernina, so I researched cheaper machines to figure out what to purchase. This machine sews smoothly and has many nice features of more expensive machines that I was looking for; needle stop up/down, stitch selections, walking foot, no problems with tension, it even has a needle threader that I did not know I would appreciate. I needed a machine to last me a few years until I could save up for a nicer machine, and so far this one has performed as needed without driving me crazy. Some cheap sewing machines have chronic tension issues that can drive a sewer insane, and this one has had no problems. My only real complaint so far is that the presser foot up position is not as generous as I would like. It can be hard to get bulk under there and I sew clothing for my kids, so the seams can be difficult to get through there. I would recommend this machine as a good starting machine or take with you to sewing group as it is lightweight and easier to move than heavier machines. Since it is lightweight, it does not feel as sturdy as my old Bernina, but it is a good in-between and I am happy with my purchase.
The Fasturn ad included a storage box.When the order arrived there was not storage box.When I contacted Amazon, they informed me the box was not available any more.At that point they offered 10% refund, I did some calculations and decided I would return the Fasturn for complete refund, I am stillwaiting for the refund to show up on my credit card account summary.
The product description needs to be changed. I bought this glue specifically because the description says it works on fabric. This is not true. I tried gluing plastic to fabric and that did not work. I also tried gluing fabric to fabric. That also did not work. There was not even any adhesion between the pieces; they fell apart as if there were never any glue applied between them. The items I used were dry and I let them sit undisturbed for a day.The product works fine gluing paper to paper, and attaches them better than Elmer's.
Full disclosure: I'm a crafting/glue gunning (yep, it's a word) newbie, so some of the problems I have with this damn thing might be solved with some common tip or trick the pros use that I'm currently unaware of. Granted the item is $11-$12, so perhaps I simply got what I paid for.Anyhow, here goes:--My biggest issue with this glue gun is the tip (that's what she said). Ha, but seriously folks, it seems like there is a never ending stream of glue spilling out when it's propped up on it's dinky little stand (which constantly snaps off). All together I'd say it's wasted at least 3 full glue sticks over just a few weeks. Bummer.--My second biggest gripe is that the glue stick has to be manually pushed through the barrel in order to work. Now, as I said, I'm new to this, so I certainly haven't developed the coordination to do this. Also, it's ANNOYING. Why is there a trigger in the first place if it isn't serving the ONE PURPOSE it's meant for?--The stand sucks--it's really flimsy and pops off every now and then. This causes the gun to topple over sometimes landing in the aforementioned puddle of piping hot glue. If only the stand were thicker, wider, and didn't completely suck, my fear of glue gun related burns would disappear.--This might be common of all hot glue, but that shit is STRINGY as all hell.--Glue turns brown? I assume this is because the gun is too hot and burns it, but there we go again--more wasted glue.Overall, I give this product 2/5 stars and a whole lot of sad faces. :( :( :( :( :(
I am a long-time Amazon purchaser, but this is my 1st product review-that's how egregious the difference btwn the product & the product description.Having read the description-"furniture grade compressed cabinetry" "durable melamine finish," then looking up the plywood grading scale, I paid $138 (now listing for $145) for the item.Calling it Walmart quality is probably an insult to Walmart's line of cheap pressboard crap as the pressboard was so loosely bound that there are multi edge/corners with "gaps" btwn the "durable melamine finish" & not-so-"furniture grade cabinetry". There is no doubt these gapped edges will be the first place the finish peels away from the pressboard.I took a photo of (one of many) gapped edges, & the looseness of the pressboard is also visible, & hope I can figure out how to attach it.
This has "sort of" worked one time. After that, the battery does not re-charge or hold a charge. Just when you really need it for a school project for your child. I am now stuck with two boxes of glue sticks, a glue gun that won't heat up and a charger/battery that makes it look like it is charging...basically a pile plastic and parts. Go with the standard corded.
There's nothing wrong with this calendar, in fact it's great. I personally didn't check the size so found out too late that a normal page can only be inserted horizontally. So please check that, otherwise as I said it is a really good do-it-yourself calendar.
Product failed after 50 pictures when it was supposed to print 150 pictures. Cartridge was outr of ink.
The first template sent was bent and crumpled, so I sent an email stating that fact when asked to rate the merchant. A replacement was sent, but it was in worse shape than the first. I did not send in another complaint, as I figured there was almost as much smooth space on the 2 I had received than would be had on an undamaged sheet, unless I wanted a space larger than 4x4&#34;. I would never order this again.
I was hoping for a small easy to use magnifier for threading needles and reading tiny print etc. This does not work for me but it was cheap, so nothing lost.
I was searching for a good dye for nylon, the product says it is great. I tried it, did everything it asked, and no good results, poor product.
These scissors are much like the several others that I have: they cut well but also hurt my fingers. The hard surfaces have a way of applying pressure to the wrong parts of my fingers when I open the blades. From the picture, it looks like the inside of the finger holes might be soft and pleasant. Instead, they are merely a different color. Despite the product description, I don't feel anything soft about these scissors.These scissors cut more evenly than theWestcott Titanium Bonded Non Stick Scissors, 8" Straightthat I also got from Amazon Vine, needing consistent pressure throughout the cut. I'd choose these over the non-stick scissors.
We love the easel and have enjoyed writing on the dry erase board.The only problem is then the markers go on the wood it does not wash off and leaves it marked up.
For a few scissors stuck together, it works well shredding a few sheets of paper. It is hard to get it to cut thicker things than this. Much more compact than an actual shreder, and better than just tearing up the bills.
I've used this paper millions of times over the years, and what I received was the correct product, but this is the first time it's arrived warped - it's vertically curving, and the prints never lie flat. Which is a major disappointment.
I purchased in hopes this would expedite the star-fill process I would be using to decorate a race car cake. I tried it with and without the large coupler and both methods felt awkward. It took me longer to position the tip properly so I wasn't overlapping each new cluster of stars. It did not pipe nice looking stas as my regular one-star tip does. I ended up switching back to the one-star tip because it was easier to use and made nicer/cleaner looking stars.If you're decorating a very large cake and have experience with this tip it could be useful. But for me I didn't have great results. I felt like this took me much longer to achieve less attractive results. I'll hold on to it of course in case I find myself wanting to give it another try someday.One last thing - I'd recommend testing this out with a disposable bag and not wasting a new featherweight bag as I did. Being much larger than standard piping tips I had to cut my bag to accomodate its size and now its useless for other tips. Stupid mistake on my part but I figured I'd share in case you are interested in buying.
Table looks great but the "nuts" that hold the top on are cheap. Three of them came off allowing child to lift top of table up. Needs to be better quality for the price. I would not purchase another one or tell anyone to.
The quality is verygood and takes about 1 hour to put together while following the directions. It really helps me organize my desK .
We use Sculpey "Original Sculpting Clay" in our mold making business for making simple pieces that will not be needed long-term or subjected to a lot of stress. This is easy clay to work and takes detail without much effort, but it is not durable and can dry out if not baked. Since we don't usually want to take the time to bake our pieces, we useSuper Sculpey Polymer Clay - Semi-Transparent Beige-Pink - 1lb.when we need a more durable medium.Recommended!CFH
OK! Thanks. Otherwise, this holding tool is too small on the head and is hard to keep the ring stability to solder it.
This is not not enough and is way to expensive .There is no difference than with Ritz dye..I wish I never paid so much for a product that fades..It didn't even work..
For the most part, this lot is decent. The colors are pretty. I wish the beads were bigger. Some 8mm and 10mm in the mix would be good. The 3mm seem way too small.I would give 5 Stars if I could pick my own sizes and colors!
The description says brushes but this only includes one. Great quality, with the handle and bristles, but not expected at all.
I needed pliers in a hurry, so I purchased these hoping they would work like others I have seen used. They did the job of closing the case, but not without a little effort. The pressure applied when closing the pliers on the watch case tends to slip off to one side not locking the case. I have to secure the case on the pliers with one hand and ensure the rubber backing on the plier head keeps level pressure on both sides of the watch case. It's still a good tool for the price...and works just fine.
I buy just for present so that I do not known its good or not
These are excellent brushes for the money invested. The metal part does not come unglued from the wood when it sits in water like many brushes I've used (although the outside coating on the wood often does flake off but the brush is still useable). Also, I often paint on wood which really tears up brush bristles; these brushes hang in there way better than most.
itworks wonderfully and springs back into shape after it is cleaned, It is easy to use and now I want a whole set.
I don't have much space at my office for picture frames, but I have a locker and file cabinet next to my desk. These work perfectly.
I am a mosaic artist and like to keep a variety of materials handy. The glass quality was so poor I thought it was some kind of plastic. It appeared to be random glass objects that were smashed and tumbled. It was disappointing because Amazon is my "go to" place(I have your Amazon rewards credit card). I was forced to shop at EBay to get a decent selection of choices.I chose the one star rating because you didn't offer a zero option .
Case came to my home all scartched up..One of the two cases had a broken hinge and it could not be used!!! Very bad product stay away if yer smart!!!
I ordered 2 of these Elmer's 3D Washable Glitter pens. One for myself & one for my sister. Weboth do homemade cards. And I do painted T-Shirts. Have tried them for the cards, not for theshirts as yet. They are fantastic. Just open, give a slight squeeze & get started.Adds so much dimension to the cards. The Glitter spreads out evenly & so easy to use.The order came quickly & all in good shape. Would re-order this product again. Dolores in Calif.
I used this to detail a prop pistol from the video game Halo.Clean the surface well, or it won't bond well.You don't need to be generous with this stuff, a little goes a LONG way.rub it on, let it dry for an hour.Buff the shine how you want it.WAIT. WAIT FOR DAYS. DO NOT HANDEL. If you do, you'll notice that the wax will rub off. I got it to not rub off on my pistol after letting it sit in a cool, air conditioned environment for 7 days.**UPDATE**It's been several months since using the product on my prop and its holding up well. The prop went through a few conventions and sweaty hands but has shown no signs of coming off. The material it was bonded to is plastic, smooth cast 300 to be precise. It's worked great. My main suggestions are again, clean the surface, let it dry completely and apply this stuff and work it how you want it. Then, you have to fight the urge to touch, handle, or monkey with it. Seriously, patience is a virtue.
I bought these scissors (the 8" version) at my grocery store for less than $2, and they really are not even worth that.These scissors don't open and close smoothly--it requires a little effort. And then, when you try to cut something, they don't cut very well, either. I was trying open a package that came in the mail and these scissors kept getting caught and kind of jammed up, and wouldn't cut, and they'd get stuck, and it was just much, much harder than it needed to be to open my package. Partway through, I gave up on using these and used a kitchen knife instead. It was a difference of night and day. (And my kitchen knives are not that fancy!)I've tried to use them for other things in the past several days, and they are unexceptional in every case: they don't cut paper things well and they don't cut plastic wrap or packaging well. They are pretty useless.These scissors SEEM like a good idea since they're Scotch brand and they boast a 5 year limited warranty, but they're worse than a generic version from the dollar store. And really, is it worth my time and trouble to try and use their warranty to get a refund of $2? Of course not.Pass on these. Buy anything else instead.
I purchased this machine less then one year ago. It has been repaired three times since; twice for the take up lever disconnecting and falling into the casing. My hope was to use this machine to do machine quilting and I have had to resort to doing most of the work by hand. My next purchase will definitely NOT be a Singer. The repair costs have almost equalled the purchase cost. Not a good deal. This machine has inferior quality and workmanship. Made in China.I will be buying a new machine soon and it definitely won't be a Singer. Bernina here I come!Don's wife.....
If you have a small photo or picture (3 1/2 inches square) that you want to project and enlarge, this is a good inexpensive projector, but if your photo is bigger and you have to move the photo under the projector to get to another area, it is almost impossible to realign everything. If you move the photo and disturb the projector by moving it slightly backward, forward, or to the side, the focus will change. You have to work in a very dark room to get a good image. If you pull the lens out too far to focus, it will fall out on the floor and break, so be careful. It's okay it you just want to project and trace a small area of your photo, but otherwise, it's a lot of trouble to use.
I was so excited to rcv this as a Christmas gift to assist in some mural work. It was the biggest disappointment. If you have a coloring book image with bold black lines and you are in a DARK room... not a dark room, but a room used for photographic development, with absolutely NO light, you can see a blurry image. But totally useless for projecting under normal circumstances.
I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. It was an expensive foot with lousy directions. There were only a couple of pictures for directions. There were no written directions, trouble shooting or anything to assist with using this foot. I purchased the ruffler foot because I make numerous garments with ruffles and I was hoping it would allow me to speed up the process. Unfortunately it takes longer than manually making ruffles. The metal clamps, for lack of better word, catch the fabric and there is not a guide to ensure you sew in a straight line. I would prefer to return this item because it is truly a waste of money.
I purchased this set from Joanns when they had a sale....it was cheaper at Amazon, but I didn't want to wait the 2 days it would take for the set to arrive.The instructions were not the greatest, but I found some videos online that made it really simple! I also found a lot of patterns and really great detailed instructions on the provo craft website.So far, I have only used the yellow long loom and I made a scarf while sitting at work...it turned out awesome!!! I just finished my second scarf as a gift for my grandmother...it also turned out beautiful!I will be getting a lot of use out of this set! I have found tons of patterns for different items and different stitches online...just do a google search.There are quite a few loom knitting books out there....I purchased just about every one of them at Amazon as they were much cheaper then they are at my local craft stores!This is actually a very fun and relaxing way to spend an afternoon!
Container cracked after about 3 weeks, before even completing the first batch. Additionally, no fine grit was included in the package. I would not suggest purchase of this item.
I Would never get this product again because the metal is cheep and the cuffs don't even work... Spend the extra buck and get a pair of Smith And Wesson.
the problem starts with The manual for the Euro-Pro serger Model 534DX, from it, no one can understand how to thread the BOTTOM LOOPERS.The manual was written by someone other than English speaking as obvious by the paragraph titled &quot;How to use the Lower Looper Automatic Threader (For certain type only)&quot;.The diagrams for the Automatic threader do not continue from the previous diagrams for the lower loopers.Their manual offers 24 hour support, but the 800 telephone number (800-798-7398) goes straight to India, where a man tells you he can't answer your question, his English barely understandable.He also gave me another 800 number(800-361-4639), that only gives you a busy tone.Also part of their telephone support machine tells you go visit their Web site, but is so incoherent that I had to search the Internet to get the correct spelling.then to add insult to injury, their Web site only deals with Vacuum Cleaners, not sergers. I wonder why??I also called HSN, where I purchased the serger, and their Customer Service person could only help me by giving me a non 800 telephone number (517-842-8691), where &quot;people who cant get through on the 800 number have better luck getting through&quot;.Unfortunately, there is no such number.So with 5 xmas gifts to sew and no answer for ONE LITTLE QUESTION, &quot;HOW DO YOU THREAD THE BOTTOM LOOPERS CORRECTLY&quot;?and one expensive paper weight serger, I rate it as useless!!!!!!!!!!!!
the picture made me think i was getting 6 sets of needles i thought it was a great deal but when i got the package it only had one set and the color was not of my choosing most companies put in your choice of colors but not this company and when i emailed the company i did not get a replySusan Bates Crystalites Yarn Needles
This is basically a thin piece of fabric with pinked edges. When ordering it was not particularly clear what exactly this would be like and for the price I took the chance it might be good. I like the size for doing larger pieces, but it is not particularly see through and works no better than a piece of scrap muslin or any other cotton fabric.
It is good for wide spaces but as you go smaller it just does not do well. I need to get a better one for more detailed work.
Hooks are fine, but the sizes were VERY small or VERY big - I needed more in-between sizes for my project.
This product is just what I was looking for. If you want perfect pay the bigger bucks. For the money this is a great deal even if the case doesn't shut.
Does a 70/30 job of cutting perfect corners. You need to turn the punch upside down to watch your alignment.
It fell apart in the first wash. The fabric it very thin and doesn't hold up well. We didn't like it.
Not worth it if you are only buying this product as shipping cost is very high
I did not buy enough of yarn. I went back to buy more it was discontinued.I found it on Amazon.com [..]. It ended up to be less money and the quality was first rate. I would use them again. My blanket was able to be finished in time for the newborn baby.
These are excellent brushes for the money invested. The metal part does not come unglued from the wood when it sits in water like many brushes I've used (although the outside coating on the wood often does flake off but the brush is still useable). Also, I often paint on wood which really tears up brush bristles; these brushes hang in there way better than most.
delivered on time. the picture showed it can sew everything but not on thick material. overall it is economical......
I liked this product overall, which was good since I and my sisters-in-law did a lot of the work. My niece (who is six- may have been a little young for the product) really liked the idea of making the quilt, but wanted the product to be finished "yesterday." She did help and was able to pick up the fairly easy knotting technique quickly, cutting down on frustration.Upon finishing it, she was very happy to be able to say she made it, so in that aspect it beats a traditional present by a mile. Yes, I could have gotten her a fleece blanket with some pattern (which is what it is; it can't be compared to actual quilting), but she was much more excited about this.Would buy again.
Perfect for attaching my over-the-belt phone holder to my belt loop. This method has already saved me from losing my phone. The only problem was, one of the FOB's broke. It was a bit flimsy. In fairness to the seller, I did not contact them to report the problem. I would buy this FOB again.
This is a great carving block to practice with for the price. I just prefer a stiffer carving medium for precision. If your design doesn't require a lot of precision or your hands can't handle the stiffer premounted linoleum blocks, this is a decent carving medium to consider.
I use this to cover the windows in my warehouse. I was originally going to order mini-blinds but that would set me back about $1000 to cover all the windows. I decided to use this product instead.For my application, even though this product is somewhat thin, you cannot see through it, even with light shining on it from the opposite side. The light shows through the duct tape much more than this paper.Light does come through to some degree as the black paper shows up as opaque in my surveillance cameras, but black in person. But looking from outside in, it does act as a nice privacy screen.It is very easy to cut. I roll out as much as I need, mark and cut with a utility knife. A utility knife is best, since the blades will wear out quickly, cutting over a concrete floor. Using scissors will prove inaccurate and slow.
This projector must be used in an absolutely dark room to be effective at all. The projection is very weak and the area that it can cover from an original is very small. I had to keep moving my original around and trying to get it lined up against what I had already traced on the wall. It is inexpensive and you get what you pay for. If you only need it occasionally for small items, it is okay. If you plan to use it a lot or do any kind of large project, it will be frustrating.
My son's #1 fave color is purple. So I was a little annoyed that there was light blue, dark blue...but no purple! The paper is a little on the thin side, but nice vibrant colors.
This was pretty good for the price. The only complaint I have is that there is pink on the wings of my mat, but no pink yarn. Will probably need to substitute the color for another color that has extra yarn. I just hope there is extra. It was appropriate for my 9 year old and kept her busy for a while. Directions weren't that great, but if you look on you tube, there were videos to teach you how.
Excellent picture quality, but ink expires long before you get to 150 prints. Also, the second ink cartridge was defective!!!!Tough item to assess.

I have been working with chalk pastels for quite some time, and this paper is far from ideal for that particular medium. The weight is nice, but the surface has a texture that's difficult to lose. By which I mean, color won't penetrate evenly without being scrubbed in.Forgive the unorthodox lingo, but I would not recommend this paper for hard chalk pastels.
Looked like a great idea but the magnet is too weak to support anything heavier than a piece of paper.
So many products make promises they don't keep. This is one of them. They say it's tough.Sorry, it's not tough at all!I started making chainmaille jewelry recently and needed the softer jaws on my pliers for the soft metals like aluminum and silver. I have to redip my pliers every week and then they are out of action for 24 hours becuase I let them dry for that length of time. The coating peels off after just a couple of days use. I even tried a friend's suggestion of double dipping but that didn't last either. I'm looking for something more permanent.Beware buying it online as the price is jacked up. It's half the cost from a craft store even with tax added.
I've never used a machine in my life, so I was very nervous about how "easy" it would be to use. I'm glad to report that it's true! Read the starting up guide, and I was off and sewing. I'm starting off slow..hems, next is pillow cases and curtains and this is just perfect for me...
This was perfect for my needs. I didn't purchase it as a toy, but rather as a paint sprayer for a project I was doing. It worked perfectly. Don't forget to purchase the can of pressured air to make the gun spray.
im not a big seamstress, but this seems to fit my bill with the budget of this dress form. im sure if you have more particular tasteds and are an avid dress form user, this might be a bit clunky to you as the adjustments are clunky and stand a bit wobble, but it seems ok to me who dosnt use something like this all the time.
Not good paint. Very thick. Resembles marshmallow cream. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I needed something a lot smoother and thinner.
My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved the table and chair set. It is the first Christmas gift that she went for!! Her father, my son had no problems with assembly, and everything was numbered and easy to follow. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with is that there were no screw caps/dollies which did take a little bit away from the looks of the chairs as they stuck out in the backs of all of the chairs.. Otherwise, for the money, it was made very well and seems to be very sturdy.
We liked this item. We use it to trim our 2 year olds hair. Note that the ends are pointy which makes me a little nervous when I am trying to cut his hair; otherwise great.
I expected better from the Swingline family. This hole punch sticks and doesn't retract properly. I wasn't overloading the hole punch either. Perhaps I just got a bum model.
Ive used dozens of these pens over the years maybe even hundreds they work good when you first get them but they always leak around the tip under the cap I dont know what the deal is but its a problem I always have with the MICRONS I really like these pens for art but they are expensive for a pen thats gunna leak and you will just have to throw in the trash for this reason I dont even use this brand anymore I recommend the Faber-Castell PITT artist pens instead they are very nice and dont leak
This yarn is soft, but strong and because of the larger size, it's super fast to work with. The strands stay together really well, unlike some yarns where you find yourself catching/snagging on half the strand or in places that you don't want to be. One review mentioned a glittery string, and I think that may only be in a few select colors, as mine didn't have that and many of the colors I've seen in stores didn't either. Love it, great for making hats and stuff like that. As one review said, it is probably cheaper to drive to the store and buy it though, if you can find it there.
Brother CS6000I 60-Stitch Computerized Free-Arm Sewing Machine with Multiple Stitch Functionssuper machine to use with a great results.light weight and very well done with multiple stich functions..I use this more than the more expenisve one I own.I take it with me all over the place.. I travel and sew quilts.The only draw back is the narrw opening at the top.. So you fold the quilt top and use the bigger ones for the middle part.I am so glad I got this MACHINE. Yes, I would recomend this to a beginner or pro..don't let the weight fool you in any way... Push button controls for operation of motion no foot pedal needed to operate!!!!I use it all the time just think you DONOT have to use the foot pedal if you are HANDICAPPED as I an am. Need to elevate your knees or the legs?That's right no foot pedal if you want it is so cool.......!!!!!!wish they would make a more deluxe than this one!!!!Thanks,Brother for great machineThanks, Amazon for a freat price toooo...try it..
I bought this sewing machine three weeks ago and am working on my first quilt. I've been using the walking foot for a few days and the walking foot 'jumps'. It's a defective walking foot. I called Brother, and expected them to send me a new walking foot. That would be decent customer service for a brand spanking new machine. Right?!No. I need to send them the foot with proof of purchase, and they are going to test it out and let me know what they are going to do about it. Seriously?!If I still had the box, I would send the entire thing back. Talk about not standing behind your product.
We have had this chair for about 2 months, so I am not sure about durability yet. It is more of a terry-cloth material than chenille. And it doesn't rock very much or very well. But my daughter loves it! She is in at all the time!
I have 4 of these printers that I use for special events at the church. I bought 4 packs of ink for Halloween and one of them gave me the low ink notice after only printing about 10 of the auto nozzle clean prints.I thought it might be a fluke, so I just let it print until it ran out, which was about 20 prints later.I threw that cartridge away.This weekend, I bought 6 print packs and 1 of them did did the same thing. Reported low-ink after only printing the Auto Nozzle prints.I haven't printed any prints from the cartridge, I ejected it and put it back in the box.$33 is a lot to spend to only get 20-30 prints out of a cartridge.
Super thin...These are sheets of thin poster board that has been punched into the sizes. They tear easy and a waste of money.
I bought this set for my preschool class. The paints work fine but they are a little "globby". The paint isn't the best quality but when it is mixed with dish soap (to help get paint out of clothes) it is fine. I would probably buy it again just because it was cheaper.
My machine is alot smaller then this case, so it does move around when I carry it... if I had seen it before purchasing I probably would not have got it, but it does pertect it if I'm not moving around too much... I guess that's what you get with a "Universal" case.
I have been sewing for 50 years and have never had a machine like this one. Thread breaks because it wraps around spool holder, bottom thread breaks, I have tried every thing that in my experience of 50 years has taught me and with no success. I am an avid sewer and put any machine that I use to a grueling test. This machine should be sold only to a NON sewer that way they wouldn't know any different. This machine is very light weight, and the cover is useless. The cover can only be used to cover and not transport. CHEEP ! I intend to put it in the garbage because that is where it belongs, I wouldn't stoop so low to sell it to my worst enemy.
I was so excited to start the green hat on the cover. Unfortunately, the instructions were vague at best and completely leaves out steps at the end, so you end up with a flabbergasting flat mush of felt when you are finished. Easily the *worst* pattern instructions I have ever worked with. What is worse is that they never show you a photo in the back of the hat, so you literally have no idea which end is up. I ended up having to search online for other people that managed to piece the thing together and look at those photos. I highly recommend looking up the photo instructions for the green hat from the "Fashionable Forties Blog" - without those instructions I would have burned the thing in frustration!
This machine is a great value. It does everything I need and more. The pack of extra feet and accessories is pretty complete.
I did not read the description correctly. They are way too small and not well constructed. Not worth the trouble to return.
I bought this for my 8-year-old daughter for Christmas. She has used it several times and really enjoys it. It was exactly as advertised.
I needed a better organizer for my scale model bench. I had tried building my own. I am a model builder not a carpenter...unfortunately. I saw this on Amazon and really liked the simplicity.PROS: Looks good and has drastically cut down the clutter on my bench.CONS: Packaging and material. USPS dropped kicked the box and then had a UFC match with the it! I ended up glueing four pieces back together. The wood is almost a balsa quality type wood. Very soft. I had expected a harder wood for the price.Overall: I am happy with it but felt that for price they could of packaged it better and made it out of a sturdier would.
It works just fine but it hasn't replaced my safety pin. My trusty safety pin does the same job and does it well for a fraction of the price.
I shopped several locations looking for an electric hole punch that was under $100. Couldn't believe the great price on this hole punch. So far so good, it functions as it should. Delivery was quick. I am pleased and would recommend this item to anyone who needs an electric punch.
It was a bit dry and has almost no smell left. Since I only bought one, it's not worth returning, but I will stick to buying ink pads at the store since I can return them if they are dried out.
I got these along with a set from amazon.com of circular knitting needles and these are a great addition to my knitting supplies. Good quality!
This puncher broke- literally fell apart in two days of usage. I've never had this problem with this brand before, but I thought this was worth noting.
I polish a lot of silver and Hagerty has the best products on the market. I use the polish after I have cleaned the silver with Hagerty's Silver Foam.
I received an LS-2125 as a gift from my daughter and was initially very pleased. Until I tried to use it to sew a button hole in a shirt. I had to adjust the button hole stitch but when I touched the adjustment knob, it fell out of the machine (it is plastic. why companies use plastic for machined parts escapes me).I contacted the company for warranty service and they informed me I would have to ship it in at my expense and pay for return shipping and any repair work that is performed...this is MORE than the cost of the machine.I also got the distinct impression from both the customer service folks at Brother & the nearest authorized service center (which is over 70 miles away) that I got what I deserved for buying their low end machine. The service center owner said he would be glad to sell me a machine that is reliable and works...sooooo let this be a warning! Do Not Buy Brother Sewing Machines!
It does everything it says it does. It works best in a dark(er) environment. It was a bit tricky to fix on a six foot folding table, where I work. Perhaps later I shall splash out and buy its stand. The arm extends quite a long way up and one can adjust the size of the image. I have only used it once so I cannot comment on the length of the life of the bulb. Fairly simple to assemble with clear instructions. Good value for money. My intention is to use it to cut down unnecessary time re-sizing from my photos. I want to paint not draw and this artograph cuts down drawing time. I find this very useful and valuable. Not recommended if you want to draw in or see every tiny detail of the original. I was able to draw the outlines of the major parts of the original photograph, after it was enlarged on the painting surface, and hey presto I started painting. No delays or frustration with pencil drawings or sizing. So far very pleased with it.
Never made a scrap book before. This made it so easy. All of the scrapboooking paper comes in 12x12 and the white paper that comes with the 10 included sheets is good quality. Loved this book and so did my Mother-in-law.
Good price, does the job, but hard to figure out the different stitches and how to use them. Instruction booklet needs to be a little more detailed when it comes to choosing different usage of stitches.
Purchased this as a gift for the "artist" in the family. It appears to be as described, but I cannot judge the quality as compared to other brands. Only she can tell after using it, if it was what she wanted.
I use this for college. It punches about 10 sheets. It help keeps all my papers organize in my binder.
As usual, I am a Bob Ross fan and feel so comfortable in using his products and Amazon always has what I need when I need it. If you have watched Bob Ross on TV, you know this is a brush that you need.
This costs about $3 a sheet off of Amazon.It does come with instructios, but they're a bit insufficent as they doesn't tell you which side to iron. It's an easy enough guess so I ironed on the printed side, right on top of my printed image. It doesn't look as seamless as the t-shirt iron-on transfers, but it looks good enough to use as a gift for someone. Since it is a gift, I don't get to test it to see how it will hold up, but the adhesive seems to hold well, so I'm not worried about that part. I tested it on some scrap fabric and tried to pull it off. It was not coming off without a fight so I gave up satisfied that the adhesive will hold through washing.You have to cut the image out exactly if you don't want the white backing on your project and any unevennessin cutting will show as well. I can't say I'm very happy with the results with using it on a shirt pocket. It would probably do better on a tote bag, but it's good enough. It looks really good from a distance.I don't think I like it enough to get more when I run out, but I will have fun using what I have.
I don't know why they call this the Original Buttoneer? This is not the original or Vintage version with just one needle. I found the Vintage Buttoneer (the one with only one needle)to have much more sturdy fasteners. If you have the Vintage version or are able to find it, the old fasteners in the box are too old and brittle. I was given the address to order the original fasteners (in new condition)Buttoneer FastenersP.O. Box 557Franklin, MA 02038You have to write them and request information, there is no website, or phone number available. I hope this helps some of you.
I bought this to help me project line drawings onto a wall before painting a mural. I was able to mess with this product to get it to do what I need but almost not even worth it.Cons:-you need to be in a completely dark room for the projection to show-you can't just place the projector over an image, it has to be propped up on something so that the bottom hovers over the image or it won't show (I can't imagine a child using this!)-you can only project from a tiny image (like 2x3in) although you can piece together an image in theory, this is impossibly hard because any change in position and you will not be able to line up the new image. This would not be so hard if the darn thing wouldn't have to be rigged up to hover over the image in the`first place.Pros:-only affordable projector I could find anywhereSuggestions:-they should add adjustable feet to each corner of the base that make it easy to consistently change the angle of the projection while keeping the base hovered over the image.If anyone had better luck than me and wants to give me tips for better use I'm listening!
Cheap and works while being compact, but it feels flimsy.The price is great though, no complaints there at all...
I really wanted to like this machine. Got it on a lightening deal from Santa to my 9year old daughter. Out of the box before threading or anything it was grinding. Santa failed on this one. Brother was going to send it for repair, but I just got a replacement from amazon. This second one has tension issues. Too tight, too loose. Changes within the same run. Frustrating. I spent an hour and a half working on it and finally got too frustrated. She came to me later so sad that it wouldn't work. There is no way she could work on this somewhat alone with the thread catching in the bobbin case so much. May oil, may get new metal bobbins, but may send this second one back. I have another brother, the 400 version for embroidery and sewing, I love that one and really hate this one.
These guys must have laughed hysterically when they decided to call this paper Heavyweight... or even White for that matter, and just for fun, made up the word Duo-Finish.First off, the paper itself was wavy and completely uneven, almost like it had been exposed to moisture or humidity. It was not smooth at all, is an icky, off white color, and both sides were equally crappy. It's as thin as cut-rate copy machine paper. Unlike the photo, it does not come on any kind of core, and the center is wound so tight you can't slide it onto any kind of rod to use as 'roll' paper unless you spend a half hour to hand loosen it. Even if you bother, it will end up sagging on whatever hanger rod you put it on instead of sit in a clean roll, making it very awkward to use.You can completely forget trying to use it as cheapo photography background paper, and is so crappy looking, will show in anything but the most blurred backgrounds. I can't imagine it's much good for anything EXCEPT letting a child scribble with crayons on it. It's basically going to end up as wadding for shipping/package filler.Seriously, pass this junk right on by and purchase a decent brand...It's pathetic.;(..
I started making jewelry a year ago, and I absolutely love swarovski, so i bought these. I thought they would be a bit bigger though. No doubt about, it I love the beads, but on my opinion, you should get the 1000 count with a wide variety of sizes and colors, it is a much better deal too.
I have larger cutting mats, but this one really came in handy when I was working with smaller squares and paper piecing. It didn't take up nearly as much room and could be right beside my sewing machine.
I hate that it doens't go through the door frame. Annoying! But I really like the look and the storage.
These embossing plates are very easy to use, and so cute too! I have used them several time and the results are great every time! Highly recommend
Not good paint. Very thick. Resembles marshmallow cream. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I needed something a lot smoother and thinner.
The drawing pad was a Christmas gift for a young girl that shows artistic capabilities. I understand she is pleased with it.
My new singer 5040 was delivered yesterday in the middle of the longest winter I can remember. The machine itself is great especially for such an affordable price. I have lots of projects all ready to be sewed since I was waiting for this machine to replace another beloved Singer that died. My disappointment was in finding one bobbin packed with it. Since bobbins I have on hand won't fit I'll have the inconvenience of rethreading that one over and over until the roads clear enough to go to a store that has them. The photo plainly shows 6 bobbins and 2 of each attachment. I got one of each attachment and only 1 bobbin. If purchasing this product you might want to plan ahead.
I was very dissapointed with this product. When you enlarge the dressform it creates gaps so that when you fit a pattern or muslin to the form there is no place for the pins to attach. I was very pleased with the order process. I received my product expediently and with no damage. Thank you, Andrea
I have been trying to return this item, but I can not get a response!
The Gardenia Scrapbook, although the design is beautiful, the craftsmanship was poor. The minute I opened the package, the pages were falling out of the book. I am very disapointed with this product and as a result I would like a refund and recommend it to no one.
I like how these ribbons turned out, the print was not as crisp as I would have liked, but still feel the quality is worth four stars, especially considering the price. Now with that said, please be sure to read the description well.....I missed the part where the ribbon comes on a bolt and was a little surprised when I received them with 'assembly' required. I only had to put 40ct together so it wasn't too painstaking, however, if you plan to use these for a larger party make sure you have a team of little elves to help out. In the end, I really like how mine turned out and would definitely order them again for a future small event.
So my daughter received this sewing machine for her 6th birthday from a friend. Right out of the box it did not work. None of the stitches would "catch" underneath to make the chain stitch.I spent some time fully reading the directions and adjusting the tension dial with no luck. I am a technically competent man who knows how to work a sewing machine, so not being able to get this machine to work was very frustrating. I spent way too much time assuming that this machine should just work if I got the tension right!I decided to take the machine apart to get a better idea for how this thing was supposed to work. This is not as difficult of a task as it sounds, for I really only took the under-compartment apart. I first removed the batteries, just to make the job easier and so that I would not stitch myself accidentally. There is one screw on the bottom that is recessed that needs to be removed, and then the entire bottom can be pulled off. Without a bobbin like a regular sewing machine, I figured there had to be something underneath that was not working properly. Bingo! When this unit pushes the needle through the material, it is then supposed to engage a spring loaded hook, which pops up to grab the stitch and holds it for the next time the needle comes down creating the chain effect. My needle was not engaging the body of the spring loaded hook, thus the hook never popped up to grab the next stitch and no chain was made (the directions describe this as a missed stitch and tell you to adjust the tension). The hook assembly is attached with two screws, one acts as a pivot and the other a slide. My hook assembly was pushed all the way to one side on the slide. By loosening the two screws a turn, I rotated the hook assembly on the slide so that the screw was centered in the slot and then tightened everything down. Don't forget to put the flip out storage lid back in place before reattaching the bottom to the unit. After making these adjustment, the machine now works as it should. I think if I spent a bit more time, I could adjust the hook assembly to get the stitches a little tighter, but I am just happy to get the unit working for what was a very sad 6 year old!
This product is a great replacement for a very old paper punch that no longer worked. It is easy to use.
This is dispenser is something great for when you need to tape something and don't want the tape to show
I badly needed some strong, but ergonomic kitchenscissors, so of course looked at the offeringsby Oxo, Good Grips.These scissors have a myriad of uses, are gentlefor those with problems with their hands/wristssuch as carpal tunnel, arthritis and the like.I wrote a detailed review on this product for theepinions consumer review site where I am a TopReviewer and/or advisor for Home and Garden,Pets, Beauty, Health, Online Sites, Restaurants.Come see this review, and my profile. I'm happy toanswer any questions you might have about the products/services. Thanks.Suz...
Everything works wonderful and looks great it would have been nice to have a slipover cover with it.But the price was good and Shipping Service was Great.I would Recommend it to Everyone,looking for a Good Machine at a Great Price.Thanks Brother,Thanks Amazon.
Being a Melissa and Doug product i had very high hopes, however these stamps didnt do justice. My daughter has only used them a couple of times and 3 of the stampers have fallen off already. The ink has dried up quickly too. It is a cute little stamp set and lots of fun, great for 3 year olds i just wish they were a bit more durable!
This machine is no work horse. I have used for about a year now and have &#34;tossed&#34; it aside. It is too lightweight to handle any serious sewing. Might be good for a beginner just learning, but it didn't serve my purpose. Probably give it away since my local sewing repair shop says they see a lot of them and don't recommend them.
The case is pink - not blue as shown. This was a gift for a guy. I'm still gonna use instead of going through the aggravation of a return.
The color palette is great, however the fine tip is not quite as fine as I was expecting and the ink tends to bleed out of the paper -- this was a bummer as I purchased these to make signs, and it is difficult to do intricate lettering and styling with the smaller point
Not the quality I was expecting. Product was flimsy and a not the best quality. Definitely would not recommend this item
The buddha board was given to me as a gift from a good friend.At first I wasn't too sure what to do with it. But then I realized it was a great way to practice my Calligraphy.Please check out my blog to see pictures of my work: [...]I hope that with practice my calligraphy can get as good as my mom's.
I like the sewing machine with all the different settings. Since I got it a few months ago, I have already made 3 bags/purses. They turned out really nice. I like the fact that it adjusted so well to the thinkness of the materials. My only complaint is where the lever for the foot is. It would be more convenient if you were able to lift it either from the front or back not under the arm.
I received this machine as a birthday present. The first night I tried it, the power and light would turn on and off at random intervals until I could not turn it back on. I returned it to Target where I was given half of the machine's retail price because I did not have a receipt! (Did I mention this was a gift?) I purchased a Singer 8280 and I am very excited about it. Don't waste your time or money on this machine, the frustration is not worth it!
I bought this machine two years ago. At the time, it was $800 (no, I didn't buy it from Amazon).I have never been able to use the embroidery feature. Set-up is VERY involved. Once set up, I was unable to figure out how to download the design into the machine, so that feature is a bust.As far as sewing, I like the one step buttonhole foot. I DON'T like that the needle down feature has to be tapped every time you stop the machine, so that feature is a bust.The zig-zag feature is not adjustable. I am forced to sew with a wide zig-zag.I use the machine for general sewing, but I really don't like it.
The pliers are fine, except they are not round nose. The label taped to the package indicated round, but they are chain nose. For the postage and handling, not worth returning. Oh well.
I received this as a gift after seeing it in a craft store. Of course, had I opened it and looked at it, I would never have suggested it as a gift. Aside from the obvious cheapness of EVERYTHING in the kit (including the thread, which is a fuzzy low quality), there is no way to open the thing without the thread spilling out. I assumed something with Singer's name on it would be good quality. I was wrong. Any beginning seamstress, child or adult, would be far better off buying a couple small plastic storage bins and supplying their own basic thread colors, needles, etc.
The Alex craft kits are great, and my daughter and I had fun creating these little animals together. My only issue is that the kits didn't have individual instructions, the previous Alex kits I've bought had each animal/project seperated out with instructions. So if you want more creative oppertunities this is great. But for my daughter who is just at the age range, she was kind of overwhelmed at all the buttons, stickers, and paper machet that wasn't set for any specific design.
The picture of this roll of Art Kraft Paper was different than what I received. I was expecting a brighter, lighter green. We already have 6 rolls of the color we received. This paper does us no good!
more like plastic. Disappointed. They cannot really cut. Maybe for a two year old. But not for kindergarten or first grade.
Works very well, reliable and durable. have been using it for about a year excellent. Would recommend this to others.
I just got the Knifty Knitter Straw loom. First of all I want to thank the people who made the instructions book. Is soo easy to understand and it comes in several languages! :) Great guys!This is amazing for an afternoon project for kids above 5 years old.So, if you are trying to introduce your kid to the knitting crafts Its better to start with this one than with the regular loom.The only thing that I thought was a little bit difficult was to open for the first time the holder of the straws.But I think its a very good product for begginers.
The scissors themselves are great. I ordered 2 pair. I am disappointed that I was not able to choose a color. I ordered 2 pair for my 2 boys. I know that there are "no boy colors" however, I am not willing to send my 7 year old boy to school with hot pink scissors. I am happy to do my part in getting rid of gender typing, etc. I don't think that my children have to be saddled with that job in elementary school. Please let us choose our own colors!
THE DISCRIPTION BELOW DESCRIBES A FLEXMASTER GUN BUT YOU RECIEVE THE POINTS BUT THE PICTURE SHOWS A GUN BUT DESCIBES THE POINTS
I'm impulsive. And yesterday I decided to pick up sewing.Now, I wouldn't even qualify as high up as a "beginner" - yesterday morning I didn't know what a sewing pedal or bobbin was for - I had never touched a sewing machine in my life. The most I had done was hand-sew buttons or hems or small rips. Seriously.But I got this crazy idea that I wanted to start "real" sewing. So I looked at some reviews on Amazon, and then bought the CS6000t at Walmart, along with thread, some fabric, a pack of buttons, and a couple of easy-to-sew patterns. I read parts of the CS6000t manual, but not the whole thing. Last night - that is, the same day I impulsively bought this machine - I completed a simple fleece jacket (which required going through 4 layers of thick fleece at times) for my mom. It's actually wearable and looks store bought.Many (most) people reading this review are not beginners - though perhaps some of you are. Either way, if I could figure out how to set this machine up - including getting the bobbin in, threading the needle, picking my stiches, etc ... then anyone can.This machine talks of the easy bobbin. I guess other machines are more complicated. But I just followed the instructions - put the empty bobbin on one stick, and the thread on another. Start the thread, then pedal until the bobbin is full. Then open a cover on the bottonm, drop in the bobbin, and you're done. No bottom threading is required (though, of course I have no idea what bottom threading would entail, and whether it's a pain).I've already played with about 30 of the 101 stitches. I haven't tried to change the foot as is required to try out the other stitches. But the stitches of the ones I've tried - some of them have seemed really intricate and complicated. I don't know what the seriously expensive machines can do, but it sure seems like this machine can do anything.In sum - a total non-sewer got this machine set up, used many of the stitches, and completed a project without any problems, and without encountering a single error beyond a beep telling me that I had to put the foot down before stitching.Yay for this machine! If only there was a comparable machine to clean my house.
What is nice about this tissue is that it is packaged in such a way that the sheets are flat (not folded) and in a package that has a carboard insert. If you are careful and pull sheets out one by one and store the package flat, they stay neet and don't get all wadded up. They are also made in the U.S.A. I thought they were a very good value.
I consider these to be just above average based mainly on craftsmanship. The metal is cheap - flexes too easily. They get the job done though.
This puncher works okay but it does really look like used item. And it needs a lot a effort to punch through the hole and you may need to punch it twice or more to cut it through.
This product works well as per the manufacturer's description - but be away that this paper is NOT a photo paper. It is decent for words/shapes/graphics/etc but do not think you will get good color or print quality for something like a photo. The paper seriously soaks up ink - so you will never get a deep black, for example - and all other colors will be off (when compared to a print on a higher quality photo paper). That said, it does what it promises, sticks well, and is a decent price.
I like the idea, and I use it often, but it does NOT stick to my wall for very long. It sticks great out of the box, but it falls down after a few weeks. So I tape the corners up. I have normal, painted walls (not brick or anything), so I'm not sure why it won't stick.My conclusion: It's fine, just don't expect it to stay up on its own.
I have a roll of this tape, and another roll of Scotch Shipping Packaging Tape. The latter is widely available at drug stores, food center, and so forth. The width of the two rolls is the same: two inches. The adhesive feels the same to me. Why bother to go looking for this "book tape?" Maybe the book tape is a bit more transparent. I don't think it is quite as strong as the ordinary tape.It is a fine product, like everything else that Scotch makes. I would not go out of my way to find it, because their ordinary tape is similar.
i ordered three skeins of this yarn. when i received the items, i received three separate dye lots. really? i was not notified prior to receiving the items that this was happening. it is pretty obvious that they are not of the same lot. two are similar but one is way off. i'm disappointed about that.
After desperately wanting a sewing machine, our 9 year old recieved this item on her birthday. She used it with my assistance one time and it broke. The bobbin will not thread, even after employing the assistance of 2 seamstresses. The product is cheap and the experience was very sad when you have a child who wants nothing more than to sew something for her mom.Everything I have ever read about this machine says the same. DO NOT BUY!!
There are 18 different snowflake stencil designs, of various sizes, on three clear blue sheets of plastic. Can be used for any stenciling project. I have used them to carve into clay tiles, with great success.Might be a little challenging for kids as the designs are (by necessity) rather detailed, and therefore not as open as some other motifs. Still, they could be fun to experiment with. For children of all ages.
I enjoy using my design runner handheld cordless printer.The instructions are easy to understand and to begin using.There is also pictures of on the instructions. I haveshown it to many friends already. You must get one.
I like this better that some other brands I have found..more textured and grabs paints well.
I learned how to thread from dvd and instructions are ok. I'm not a pro. There were a lot of adjustments left for trail and error. It's easier to use on sturdy fabric versus thin and stretchy.
These look great and I liked it so much that I bought another one. One is holding a large decorative spaghetti platter that my mom gave me some years ago, and the other is displaying a favorite 8x10 inch glass framed movie still from one of my favorite films. I decided it might look good that way instead of being hung on the wall, and I was right!Good Product!
I bought this machine for my Wife, as a replacement for an older machine. She says it's the best machine she ever used. The machine runs very smooth. It come with about every accessory that you need. If your looking for a machine that will do almost anything, this is a must have.
My grandniece wants to sew--bought this with her birthday money. The stiches do not hold--just unsecured loops through the fabric--unravelled instantly. Set-up, especially threading, is extrememly difficult. she even tried exchanging it for another thinking maybe she got a lemon--the 2nd was the same. She was sorely disappointed. And it was a big waste of everyone's time as we all struggled to try to make it work. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!
When I adjusted the tension tight enough to equalize the stitches, top and bottom, the thread began to break. I could not pull the fabric away from the machine in order to clip the threads without hand pulling the upper thread. When running on batteries the machine's speeds were medium-slow and medium. When the power was plugged in it ran at very fast and extremely fast. Had a great deal of difficulty in reverse. Kept stopping and chugging.
I bought this for my wifes birthday... She has sewn many different things, Rag Quilts, Blankets, Pillow cases... I have a suit that is fraying around the Button Hole and the machine has the adapter to do button holes.I think it is a great machine for the price...PS. Extremely easy to thread and load the bobbin!
I used this puff paint to "retread" some footie pjs for my son. It works well and provides a lot of traction. One tube will last for 5-6 pairs of pjs, applied generously. It does take a long time to dry.
Other than the convenience factor, this glue gun is junk. The battery is already losing it's charging capacity, after only four months. I can barely use it for 30 minutes, without recharging. You can't buy a replacement battery at all yet, plus there is only a 90 day warranty. The time it takes to heat is longer than 5 minutes. Plus the trigger mechanism refuses to feed the stick most of the time. Save your $30 and buy something else.
This iron is barely lukewarm, so it is basically useless. Plus, it's dangerous, since you can't stand it up while at rest, and it gets warm enough that it might be able to burn a paper surface. Very bad design, and not worth returning for the $7 you paid.
Lots of extra parts come with it. The guide that it comes with tells you exactly which part you need for the project and type of material. So far I have not had any problems and I do not expect any in the future.
I just dyed a batch of white cotton socks. You might notice that the product title says "forest green" but the picture shows a product labeled "tourquoise". When I first added the dye to the salt-water, it did look dark green. But somehow it, and my socks, shortly turned blue, and by the end of the process, the water itself was clearly blue much more than green. I would rate the color of my socks as being much closer to a weak-moderate tourquoise/teal than any kind of dark green (which is what I expected forest green to be). I admit that I am pretty new to dyeing fabrics, and may have messed up the sequence of steps (my soda ash package described a totally different sequence from the dye itself), but I would expect that such mistakes would result in weaker color, not shifted color. I did include a few pairs of yellow socks (white socks I had dyed yellow with RIT powder in a hot-stove sequence weeks ago but not yet worn) once I realized my new white ones were going blue instead of green, and those have indeed gone a nice rich green color.
I love this machine! The price was great! It was everything they promised it to be. I'll be recommending this to my friends.
It's a good block of wood, consistent, carves and seals excellently. I'm not sure why the star rating is for a "toy," but hey, as far as blocks of wood go, I guess this one is pretty fun.However - I've purchased this item twice, both times with a number of other items from other vendors through amazon, and several from amazon. My only complaint is that it takes much longer to ship than anything else - an order I placed a number of days later has shipped, and this still hasn't. Perhaps it simply hasn't yet been marked as shipped and is en route, but I remember that it took a good while for the first one to arrive when I purchased it just over a year ago.
The larger size needles are not pointed enough. The smaller sizes are fine. I'm looking for a good pencil sharpener to do the job.
I actually purchased these to trim the hair on my Bichons (they do not have fur they have hair) and they work very well.
I had to make 160x8&#34; circles on cardstock for a wedding DIY project. Very few circle cutters can cut that big of a size, but this one does. It wasn't painless, but this circle cutter did the job. You have to press down hard on the center to make sure the cutter didn't shift mid-cut. The 2 replacement blades came in handy.
I tried a Singer Sewing Machine before this Brother Sewing Machine, that Singer walk like a tortoise, the needle was broken after my first try of using it. Lucky that I can return the machine. This Brother Sewing Machine is much much better. This one has speed controller and drop-in bobbin. The only thing that I don't like is no where to store the sewing thread when I put the hard cover on.
This is a great lightweight machine for small projects such as mending, hemming and small craft projects. Manual made it easy to use for a beginner.
Not reccommended. Though they were very inexpensive, they still weere not worth the money. very difficult to read the size imprinted on the shaft.
This card contains nice designs that stitch out welll. Brother makes another card called "Winnie the Pooh" that contains all of these designs, plus a lot more (about twice as many) that can be found for under $99 so you might want to consider that one instead if you want more variety and design choices.
I started wearing dress pants for work and noticed that one by one my buttons were coming loose. Rather than sew them together I found Buttoneer refills at the local drug store but no actual Buttoneer. Eventually I was able to get my hands on the actual machine and spent about $25 total. The stupid thing didn't work. I tried a few more times and 7 tabs later I finally got it to work through a simple hem.It claims to be "invisible!" but the thick "clear" plastic is so fat that it shows white and is extremely obviously and tacky on any dark colored items when hemming.As for buttons, the button stays on... so long as it isn't used. Once I tried using the actual button as, well, a button, the "secure" hold of the plastic broke through. I now have little piece of white plastic sticking out of my pants where I tried to get it to work and where it snapped. I'm very unhappy and after all that time of trying to get this to work I could have just sewed my buttons on.
I hadn't paid attention to the size! So I was surprised the sheets were so long. This will be great for larger craft projects. I felt the quality was excellent.
I keep a lot of my scrapbooking items in this. It is great quality and very easy to just take with me to workshops.
I bought this to iron on a plain white shirt for myself to wear on my wedding day. Well I followed the directions and it did not turn out so great! The stones did not all transfer on to the shirt!!! So I was not happy and did not wear it that day after all.
I bought this scrapbook, elsewhere and paid more, but it's fantastic! I designed this gift to give to my husband for his last birthday. I contacted an old ship-mate (USS GRANT) and received photos, anecdotes, etc. to place in the album. It came out great and the album just helped to enhance the whole "picture!"I highly recommend this album for your Navy scrapbooking. There are so many stickers and embellishments out now, it's so easy to commemorate those Navy experiences!
The easel arrived intact, surprisingly. The box was in shambles when I received it. Not sure if this was the fault of the vendor or the shipper. OK otherwise.
I was a little skeptical buying these as looking at the picture I thought they may be too flimsy to last very long and withstand vigorous play (...my daughter can be a little rough on toys). After reading the positive reviews I decided to buy them since she loves play dough and I thought she'd have fun with these. I am very happy I did. They are not flimsy at all and feel like pretty substantial plastic actually that may stand the test of time. My daughter has so much fun with these. The only minor gripe I can think of is with the design of the rolling pin... I think it may be easier to use (at least for smaller kids..my child is 2 1/2) if the center rolling part actually rolled like a real rolling pin does. In no way is that a deal breaker though, which is why I still gave it the 5 stars. My daughter loves these dough tools ... including the rolling pin.
Ampersand's art supplies are all great. Their Pastelbord is designed to have a unique sandy clay coating. Its unique, fine grain tooth holds pastels and other dry media like no other pastel surface. I really preferred this to the pastel papers I've tried.The fine "tooth" of the surface makes it easy to blend colors, layer, and experiment with pastel techniques.Some people also use Pastelbords for water media, since they are so extremely absorbent. I haven't tried that, but I have used the "untoothed" Claybord 11"x14" Smooth and Claybord 11"x14" Textured for water media, with good results.
Very light weight and portable. Sews absolutely great. Ease to use. Very compact. Would highly recommend!
My son has enjoyed all of the tools; however, the rolling pin does not roll separately from the handle, so it is difficult for my son to roll out the dough. If I find a rolling pin that rolls separately from the handles I will get it for him. The rolling pin is the only reason I gave the product 4 stars.
Works but not for long. The ends broke off in the purse and the thing fell off. The magnet is strong and it was great until it broke. I might have installed it wrong, I will try again.
Not a very good product!!!!! When you let the thinner set in the pail for a lenght of time, the bottom eats away the seam. I found it better to go down to the local hardware store and buy one of their mixing buckets!
great tool to frost a cake in seconds with a lot less mess and time. A definite for all cake decorators and can be used for piping potatoes
Wish the range in sizes had started a couple of sizes down otherwise I really like it, and I can improvise.
The product appears to work. Kit is sort of a misnomer, I built a box to store the components. The instruction are near impossible to read even with a fairly good magnifying glass.
I really like these snips that I use on my boats bait and rigging station. Once you get used to the lock system, they work really well and cut braid, dacron and mono cleanly!
great audio books.i have received all these books and listened to the ones i marked. i will review the rest as i listen to them
I bought this to help make my own picture frames. The razors are extremely sharp! I don't use it anymore because I have no idea how to, I can't cut a straight line worth mounting.
The new blade was easy to install and gave my paper cutter new life. The order came quickly and I was able to complete my project right away.
I bought this because I just needed to hem several pairs of pants for my daughter who has short legs. It is horrible! Its impossible to get the material set, you can't use pins to hold what you want to sew, it will only sew extremely thin material which it then tends to bunch up, impossible to keep a straight line...I could go on and on. I wish I had read these reviews first before I bought it in a store.
Was concerned about the quality (price) but was pleasantly surprised in the end. This set of tools has conquered a small set of gunsmithing tasks and I can attest that these stood up quite well to milled aluminum and other metals. For the price I expected these to die under their work load but they've become part of the tool set. They might not last forever but I already got my money's worth, and they still have maybe another few projects in them, the rest is just icing on the cake!
This is needed when the paper is too thin to just lift off, as I can with cardstock. However, it is so thick that it still isn't ideal. I use my paint pallete knife, it works even better.
This product is just what I needed to organize my photos. It takes up considerably less room than photo albums and you can just pull out the sleeve you want. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to organize their photos.
I have had this sewing machine for 5+ years. I've made dog clothes, dog/cat beds, an applique quilt, and a few small things like cat toys and small stuffed animals. I'm definitely still a beginner but I have had minimal problems with this sewing machine in the time I've had it. I love the fact that the directions for threading the machine, threading a bobbin and replacing the empty bobbin are written right on the machine. I lost the manual a while ago and have been able to look at it to refresh my memory. The only issue I had was while using the zig zag stitch, it would sometimes do two zig zags and then one to two straight stitches. I'm not sure if that was user error or the machine's error. I'm upgrading to a Singer 7258 (for some added features and as a gift to myself) but am definitely going to keep this around for throwing it into the car to take to the family's place (we craft together a few times a year :)...).
I bought these for my 4 year old, to try out scissors. I figured they would be easy for him to use and just the right size.They don't work well. The paper gets caught in the scissors and it's quite frustrating.Also hes not coordinated enough to hold paper AND cut at the same time.They don't cut well.I wouldn't recommend these; a waste of money. These were recommended by someone who's child has tried them/they worked well: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013NDVCM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&m;=ATVPDKIKX0DER so I plan on getting those to try out.
I wanted to create calendars for our family. I found this a good deal for the printer (I have Lexmark Z54) and for the requirement. I had taken 5 calendars out of this and it works good for the double-side calendar. I could get an excellent finish. Color rendering is perfect and I did not find any smudging or bloating. The thickness is fine enough for a double-sided output.I also found Matte finish better than Glossy in case of inkjet printers, especially this one, the best.I would definitely recommend this product.
The new safety feature that requires an upward push on the striking lever before pushing inward causes a significant usability problem, three or more attempts are required to get a flame. The old design worked fine for 15 years.Unhappy.
when i received this i was so excited. there are good and not so good things about this product. pros include price, spools, scissors. cons small quantity of pins, bobbins( im guessing the bobbins may work for a singer sewing machine but for my brother machine it did not)
this was a very reasonable priced iten and it was what I needed having new pants that need to be himmed this is the right thing
this is not what I expected, I wanted a shorter reel as far as height goes, it is hard to store and heavy, I hardly use the stuff I wanted the paer to be not so tall.
There's a variety of durable stencils in a nice case. Add a few small colored pencils and it's perfect forhome or travel
We ordered the 6-pack for Christmas and only received one canvas. The actual title of the product says "6pack". This company is incredibly deceitful! We would never pay $40 for one canvas!
On Black Friday, I purchased this one first. Then latter, there was a Singer that I had been seriously looking at. I bought that too. Seeing how I can only sew on one machine at a time......I returned this one. Hope I made the right choice. The women in my family were ALL Singer fans. I'm carrying on the tradition!
You think &#34;2 pounds, Wow! That's a lot!&#34; It really isn't. Next time I will buy two bags!. You could probably stuff a large amount in two medium sized toys or several small toys.
I SENT ONE MACHINE BACK BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAVE MY NAME ON IT. BUT ONE DAY I WENT BACK TO AMAZON STILL LOOKING FOR A SEWING MACHINE. THIS BROTHER XL26001 CAUGHT MY EYE WITH A DROP IN BOBBIN,AND AN EASY THREADING SYSTEM. I WAS AFRAID TO JUMP IN AND DO IT OR WHAT? WELL I THREADED IT AND DROPPED IN MY BOBBIN. I MADE A DRESS WITHIN AN HOUR. WHAT MAKES IT FASTER IS ONE OF THESE BOBBIN WINDER WHICH I AM SURE AMAZON HAS SOME. THIS MACHINE IS MY CROWING GLORY-NOT ONE BROKEN THREAD. WITH AMAZON AND THIS MACHINE I FEEL SO HAPPY AND BLESSED.
I bought these pencils on the recommendation of my art instructors because they blend colors very well. I also bought a box of generic pencils from Wal-Mart for about $5. I use the WM ones primarily because I didn't find a dramatic difference in the few drawings that I did.
I got this chair for my daughter last Christmas. She loves it. It's pretty durable and comfy. Great size. She still fits comfortably in it at almost 3 years old. The only problem is cleaning it. Because it's such a light color EVERYTHING shows. You can't remove the cover to wash it so it's pretty hard to clean.
This machine is crap. The spool constantly falls over, the needle never stays threaded and the needles constantly break, even with the correct settings. I don't recommend it for anything beyond parks for fixing and older sewing machine.
Buyer beware. This is not your mother's Singer. They sold it off years ago and have used the name to sell cheap and poor designed sewing machines.Not happy with at all. I have used it 4 times in 1 year, very light repair stuff. Now it is totally unusable I have tried to contact Singer many times by email and they tell me to call between the hours or 9 and 5 Monday through Friday while at the machine. This is very hard to do when you work for a living. A local repair shop said it is the poor design of the bobin assembly and needs to be replaced, but doesn't recommend it because the replacement is just as badly designed.And like many of the other reviews a Singer repair shop is not close at all.
This is the THIRD pack I've used. I read the disclaimer that I should use the inkpack within 6 months. Well, the first pack, I had 30 sheets left. The second pack, I had 50+ sheets left and THIS last pack, I had 88 sheets left. That's more than half.And Epson doesn't allow you to buy the print pack without the paper.Overall, I feel compelled to try to off-label companies. You are paying a lot of money $35-40 a pack for about 70-80 prints. That's 50 cents a print.
It's very difficult to pick up the needles from the flat magnetic surface especially without long fingernails. I always dread the slow-down in my work and the momentary frustration when it comes time to try and dig a needle out of this box. There are other designs that make a needle far easier to retrieve and even an old-fashioned pin cushion seems like a far more practical idea.
My definition of strips is different than theirs. these pieces are square or rectangular. Strips to me are long and narrow. The leather is fine, just not what I had planned on. I'd call them chunks before I'd use the term strips
I ordered this product for a school project, it was supposed to be a one-inch square. What I received was an irregular measurement of 11/16 of an inch. The punch itself works well but the project was made exponentially more difficult due to this error in description. I would be wary of purchasing from this seller again.
I have tried many papers as an amateur photographer. I have an Epson Stylus Photo 2400 printer. I use the UltraChrome K3 ink and get absolutely incredible results. It is as sharp as the glossy (or nearly so) and doesn't reflect lights back. It dries almost instantly. It feels like a photo. I always get complements.
I tried to order this item and got sent a different item that I didn't even know what it was. They said there was an error on the website and they actually didn't have the template. Don't waste your time. Buy it somewhere else.
Being a teenage knitter, I was given this book as a gift and was very disappointed. I have been knitting for several years and the projects in this book were entirely too juvenile. I concede that they may be more appealing to someone who is just starting to knit, and that the authors have made a sincere effort to create projects that are creative and eye-catching. Unfortunately, this book seems to be written under the impression that teenage knitters are also not good knitters, and that challenging them would be unwelcome.
I like the idea of a two prong stiletto. It guides well the fabric when it goes underneath the foot. However, it is not very well made. If you need to put a little pressure the prongs will eventually become loose inside the handle. It has happened twice now. The first time, I contact the seller and they were very prompt in replacing it for me. But now the replacement is also coming loose. Therefore, I would only recommend it if you don't need to exercise pressure (i.e. help feed thick fabric under the foot). I decided to purchase an awl for that purpose.
Warm and Natural works better than other 100% cotton battings. I maintains it's shape after pre-shrining and does not fall apart.
Fiskar cutter great ..did not know that there is a difference between the cutter & the trimmer handle so unfortunately this handle does not fit the blade I bought which it turns out is for a Fiskar trimmer 28MM... so beware!!
These safety pins are weak and bend easily. I am very disappointed. I thought going with Singer would guarantee good quality. Apparently not. Don't but them.P.S. My 20+ year old safety pins are at least twice as strong as these.
I was trying to use this machine to make stickers to sell in my Etsy shop. It's to hard to get the stickers lined up just right. But for personal use it works just fine. Just like everything else, the refills are expensive. Haven't tried it for other things like magnets yet.
Too bad Amazon doesn't have negative ratings, because one star is WAY too high for this horror of a machine. It's a bad design [wait till you see what you have to do to thread the needle] and is finished off by bad engineering. I bought it because I, an experienced sewer, wanted an auxilliary machine to take along when so I could leave behind the big PERFECTLY OPERATING 1960's Singer given to me by my mother, when she quit sewing for my daughters.I'd heard bad things about performance of the new Singers, which isn't surprising as the company got sold, manufactury was outsourced to China and god only knows who designed the dreadful thing. But I didn't dream it would be THIS bad.My biggest complaint is that it's so tetchy. It's almost impossible to vary anything without having it go on strike. It wants to be on automatic, and it wants the trhead length and tension set just so. It doesn't like it when I vary the top tension to make the bobbin thread tighter so I can baste or gather. If the thread or fabric gets bollixed up in the bobbin compartment you have to have a screwdriver to remove the needle plate and bobbin case. Neither of the above problems is addressed in its completely inadequate guide, which gives, in three languages, only the sketchiest of instructions and doesn't in any way address the real-world problems of people who sew. And to think I only wanted it so I could make automatic buttonholes.The old Singer, a 401, is the last Singer all metal machine. It's easy to use, easy to clean when the thread or fabric gets balled up in the bobbin compartment, easy to manipulate, flexible and forgiving. The bobbin case and the needle plate come out easily so one can get into the bobbin compartment. The guide is a delight. If you can find a 401, buy it immediately. It's a workhorse, and unlike modern electronic machines that are as trustworthy as the old 401, is not likely to cost you upwards of $2000.
I have purchased quite a few Westrim strap albums, pages, and page protectors. This most recent purchase of pages for a strap album were just okay. The staple/tabs stick out further than they should and do not look secure. I am sorry to see that these products may not be acceptable for further purchase.
The gun works, but it feels flimsy. You also have to load in two glue sticks at a time, one will enter most of the way into the chamber to melt, and then the other one can push glue out. As others have said, the cord is really short and the gun takes a long time to heat up. Also, the gun is listed as using 7/16" diameter (.44 in) sticks, but it actually takes .28" diameter sticks.
The signs are great, and look exactly as pictured above. They aren't very sturdy, so you have to make sure that you supervise the children who are playing with them if they are the "rough type". If you have a child that will just ride their tricycle around them, or run around them, then don't worry.
I thought this would be a great way to make a gift... but, the kit did not have the tool needed... so I had to go find one (not that easy). I got very frustrated with this until I got into a rhythm, but still took longer and was tougher than expected. Ran out of the blue color, so had to improvise some. I don't recommend this for a first time user, maybe a more skilled user would find this Easy, Fun, and Quick.
This is sold as an adequate 1/4 inch quilting foot for my machine - the Brother CS-6000i.I loved this foot when I put it on my machine, and it does help create accurate 1/4 seems. Then I noticed the needle hole does not line up with the default needle placement of the machine. (Seems odd, no?) I said to myself, "Self, remember to change the needle position IMMEDIATELY when you turn on your machine again." Of course I didn't and the second time I went to use it, I ended up with a broken needle. To me, a foot that results in a broken needle if I don't remember to change my needle position each and every time I turn on my machine, is not a adequate foot for the machine.Look - this needle is great for quilting even 1/4 inch seems. But I doubt I'll use it too many more times. I don't want to buy needles every single time I forget to change my needle position before dropping it. I would love a foot that is made for the left-default needle position. Sadly, I can't find one...
I like the way the cover looks but it was damaged when I got it. I don't know how that could have happened because it was in an outer box and the inner box it was in was not damaged at all. I am bummed, now I have to hassle with retuning it. I will get another one though :)
The oil stick are a great medium for painting textiles. I used them with the texture rubbing plates and have wonderful results.
On Instagram I saw someone using this product for their art pieces, and they looked great via photograph, but when I ordered this product I was disappointed by it. Here's why:1.) It smells extremely toxic -- as if it's the concentrated liquid from gold/silver pens (which it probably is, but I wasn't prepared)2.) If you're used to using the &#34;regular&#34; sheets of gold leaf, this is more dull -- I was expecting it to be the liquid version of gold leaf sheets in terms of color, and it really isn't -- it's a bit more grey or silver?3.) I use oil paints, and was assuming you could use it on top of wet paint, but that's a bad idea -- it doesn't mix well with other wet (oil-based) paints, and turns everything it touches an almost &#34;chemical-y&#34; color.4.) if you're using both gold leaf and liquid leaf on a painting, you can really tell the difference between the two -- I tried to layer both, and there was a big contrast between them, instead of having them blend together as i'd hoped.All of this being said, I think my bad experience was due to my own user error, which is why I decided to write about this! If you're trying to paint on top of something that is dry, or are looking for a 2-dimensional gold feel, I could see where this would be great! It might even work better on top of acrylics, i'm not sure! I've seen pictures on instagram where artists use it to fill in entire backgrounds, and it seems to look great, so I think using this depends on your objectives! That being said, I personally really recommend the traditional gold leaf sheets, due to the richness and warmth of their appearance.
The paper quality is perfect--exactly right for wrapping, covering.I just didn't realize it was a tremendously wide roll! I thought i was buying a 200' standard width roll of wrapping paper. It is meant for bulletin boards or wrapping huge items.But I think we will saw it in half to make two big rolls.The actual craft paper is wonderful.
After reading over 90 reviews for the Brother CS-6000i, and comparing the value to other similarly priced machines, I took the plunge and ordered it. It is easy to use. The operation manual is simple to follow. After sewing for a few weekends, I think I'm getting accustomed to my electronic sewing machine. Previously, I had a Singer that finally gave out after about 35 years of occasional use. Here is my concern, also voiced by many reviewers: the bobbin tension is too loose. The bobbin thread can be pulled out with only a little effort. The bobbin is wound correctly and inserted/threaded per the manual. I have tightened the top tension as high as it can go - no change. I am going to try different weight fabrics, different thread, and anything else I can think of, before I make up my mind about keeping or returning the machine. I sew for fun but it is not fun to fight the equipment. I would appreciate any suggestions.
My paint has sprung a leak. Something to consider when orderng via post. (Also, it arrived six days after the order was placed.)
I bought this for a little boy that likes to play pretend school. It's a cute set.
I like Richards program to keep me on track with my calorie control. This however did not come with the gold foodmover pictured it came with the grey one. I did buy it looking forward to receiving the gold one, I am going to keep because I love Richard's program. I will be passing the grey foodmover that come with this to a friend.
Very cute and very nice. Comes as iron on and is very easy to put on. Have someone there that knows what they're doing when you put it on;)
Great ink! the pigmentation particles must be extra fine because I don't see any feathering or bleed like my old ink. this is waterproof so it shouldn't run. the line density is great and solid. I use it in my Noodler's Moby Dick pen and in my Lammy - both are great. Will be buying this ink for years to come.
These canvases are great, I ordered the six pack a month ago and they arrived on time. So, i ordered again, but this time only one canvas came in a huge box. Amazon is refunding my money for the 5 i didn't receive.
Really, your gonna give your child stamps and ink? My wife is crazy, but if you don't care about ink and stamps getting on everything, including the nice floor that you spent hours sanding and putting a nice finish on, then go ahead. Really, I shouldn't care, they're only little once and kids really enjoy this stuff. I'd give it 5 stars at the kids point of view, but I don't like the mess and it's a parents review.
i purchased this machine from walmart in store in november 2005 as it had a free arm that is small enough to trim and hem ladies slacks.this is important to my type of sewing as i always seem to be doing circular stitching on ready to wear as well as fashion sewing.i am very pleased with the speed of stitching and the ease of threading. the manual is excellant. also the singer company website has a full color threading guide to print out if you need a large sized picture. the #2022 needles are hard to find in stores however singer website has them in 5 packs for 5 dollars each i have ordered 5 packs as they are combo of size 11 and 14. they are special because of the longer grooves front and back to reduce friction in high speed sewing. however my manual says #2020 may be used but you have to tinker with the tensions. in regard to the creeping or machine walking i have the machine on a sturdy surface, an old typewriter table from a second hand office supply store that is on wheels and has side extensions. i placed the machine on a vinyl placemat and this cured the creeping and quieted the sound as well. for 193 dollars i got a good deal.however i would suggest this for a person who has sewn with sergers or someone who can go to an experienced sewer.
Just to specify, I am not a professional seamstress however I have owned at least 7 different sewing machines. This one by far is the easiest to tread and sew on.My grandma has been a seamstress for the past 65 years and she admits this machine is really well made and great for those who enjoy small home projects. It is sturdy and does the job on the money. I highly recommend!!!
The sewing machine itself is pretty good, but the directions are scattered and unclear. Had to have a friend help me with a few things, and she even had issues when she works with sewing machines for a living.
Had a belt I loved but they dye had come off in a number of places. This restored it to full black and looks like new. Easy to use.
this was not at all what I had expected...who wants pictures of those people in the books? Why not something a little more useful... I was sadly dissapointed in the book...but maybe was for someone else.
I've had this machine for about 2 years and while I've been able to create lots of projects, a recurring problem has been inconsistent thread tension. Most recently, the bobbin case moves too much and the thread gets jammed and bunched up. I am probably using the wrong bobbin case and some of my thread are of poor quality, so these are likely contributing factors. I am now in the market for a new machine!
received very quickly but the quality is not very good. Acceptable, but looks cheap, and feels cheap and do not think it can last long. Before this, I bought one, made in China, quality was really bad. The picture on amazon showed it was made in Taiwan, I thought the quality would be better than one I had. Bad luck. same quality. Note: the hole is very small.
I love to sew. Creating that perfect fit garment is not so difficult when you can make those little tweeks while the item is on the model. I love my double. I have the measurements set to mine and I het the perfect fit every time!The product could be a little more sturdy, but I don't plan on moving it around, so it siuts my needs
I ordered this for craft/sewing room storage and think it'll work well. The metal and plastic are very attractive although a little light-weight (chrome pieces are a little thin and hollow) so they may not last a lifetime but I think they're good enough for the price.
This machine is plastic junk that makes lots of noise. The pressor foot doesn't line up with the feed dog and you have to push the material through. The light is not worth being there. The start and stop switch is to hard to do and then try to reverse. I used it once and I felt it was going to break! I sounded like it was going to die and this was brand new right out of the box. If my full size machine was making noise like that I would take it to a repair shop. This is not worth buying! Don't waste your money! Buy something like a Viking. Pay the extra money and get your moneys worth that will last a life time.I bought it because I wanted to travel with a light weight machine that would sew anything and that is how it is advertised. It is a lie! I will still look for a light weight machine but I am going to try one out and see how it works and how it sounds before I buy it.
Very solid and sturdy. Looks good enough for the living room. Highly recommend. Good value also. Lyptus wood has an intersting story.
It takes a little practice to be accurate in your cutting of fabric. It cuts very well and through at least 4 layers of fabric. I was very pleased.
Okay, it is a glue gun. Not much to write home about.The HIGH switch gets the glue really hot. I have used it on NUMEROUS projects. I have the blisters that prove it! :-)The HIGH setting creates really hot glue, try not to catch things when you drop them.Cons:1) I wish it had an off switch, not just High/Low. I keep having to unplug it and plug it back in.2) The Main ring fell off (near the tip), and the top is separating a bit, maybe warping from heatBut the gun works fine. It does NOT come with a single glue stick... I Feel it should come with 2-3. Luckily I ordered some the same day.
And my husband who is the artist was thrilled even though they are acrylic (he much prefers oil-based). The metallics were a big hit.
Because I like natural threads, I really like this these handy- assorted color, cotton sewing spools with a needle threader & needles included.The price was very reasonable too!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6FV3O/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
I willingly paid a few bucks more for what I expected to be a quality product. I bought them about a year ago, and was pleased with them, but yesterday I went to cut a piece of paper and they fell apart! The pivot pin was all rusted!What good is the titanium if the hidden pin rusts? For this to be a quality product, it needs a stainless steel pivot. Maybe the packaging should say, Titanium", and other metals which are subject to corrosion? Would you buy it then?I think the plastic caps trap water, leading to this rusting. I ended up pushing out the pin and cutting a #8 machine screw to fit, not really worth the time and effort, but at least I have a working scissors now.Anyone know of a true quality scissors that can be expected to last a lifetime? No reason for a scissors not to, assuming it is not abused.
Tiny glue stickOverpricedNot for broad applications .. Tiny tipGet a good alternative / brand name at 99 cent store
i got this item for my 13th b-day and it was not what i expexted, this item is good if you are rich, i put some rocks in and turned it on, you had to let ti go for like a month almost but i never got to finish it becase it needed to be pluged in and it was running up the electricity bill and was costing us more money than it was worth so my mom made me unplug it. even though the rocks came out smother then they were when i put then in even though they were not in for the whole time they were also not the right shape to put it on a necles or the rings that they give you and when you do finaly get then on they fall of in like 2 days cuz the glue was not strong enough~ botton line i think you should not waste your time or money on this item~
We are a security company and use this gun for cable installation,Over the years we have tested many different brands, and this one is the best.
I ordered the sewing machine late for a Christmas gift, and had to pay extra for express shipping to get it in time. All went well, machine showed up on time in perfect condition. My only complaint is that the seller simply taped a shipping label to the sewing machine box and did not put it in a shipping box. The UPS lady was walking up the front walk when my daughter spotted her and the sewing machine box (the sewing machine was supposed to be a surprise) and quickly sent my wife to the other room so she wouldn't see what it was. If you are ordering from this seller, do not expect discretion on what is being shipped. Almost ruined Christmas.
This is a great little machine. I bought it to take with me on extended overseas trips to work on some quilts. It sews wonderfully and is very lightweight (a plus when travelling). I couldn't be happier with it, and would venture to say that it sews every bit as good as my Baby Lock or Viking machines. It just doesn't have all the bells and whistles.I have one CON for it. When sewing multiple layers, it complains very LOUDLY. Other than that, I would highly recommend this machine for anyone who travels and for beginners.
Perfect for storing comic book art from conventions, photographs, original art, genealogy preservation, etc. Easy to slide in the document, picture and fold nicely closed.
I love this sewing machine! The speed levels are great for when I need to sew slowly and quietly or for whizzing through projects. It's a breeze to operate and as always the Brother manual is extremely helpful. The only thing that I'm not completely satisfied with is the needle threader. It doesn't always line up with the eye of the needle and I have to push it sideways. It makes threading the needle very awkward and frustrating.
Definitely not the 30x its sold as. But as cheap stocking stuffers for the kids, pretty good. (Their eyesite is great, so 10x, which is what these seem to be, is perfect for them.)
This Item is great if your just cutting paper or thin material and your not trying for exact placeent. It is also hard to read the scale on the cutter.If you need to cut paper board or thicker material ths is not the one to buy.
Really offers limited protection over a cardboard box. In fact, the box that the swing machine shipped in would offer more protection.The box is poorly constructed and takes up extra space.
The buttoneer is easy to use once you get the hang of loading the fasteners and if you don't have time to thread a needle it's an ok substitute. However, it doesn't work on thick buttons, it doesn't work on thick material, it doesn't work on big shank buttons, etc, etc. Also, it doesn't deploy any kind of catch on the back of the material so the buttons can come back off easily. With the way price tags are attached to clothing today, it seems to me someone could take the buttoneer to the next level and buttons would never come off again.
I was looking for a desk and decided on the Reflections Pearl White Student Desk by Thomasville via amazon.com. During the search Amazon recommended this chair to go along with the desk and offered a discount for buying the 2 together. This chair, however, is TOO SHORT to be used at a desk. The seat is 8 to 10 inches too low. When my granddaughter sits in the chair the desk comes to her neck. I would not have chosen the desk if Amazon had not recommended it to compliment the desk. I then had to go and buy another chair.
I use lots of different size Xyron sticker machines for scrapbooking which can get quite expensive. But the Amazon price is great.
Super fast shipment, packaged well, something she had wanted for a long time, we have plenty of rocks to work with. glad i got it for her she was excited
I purchased this last month and have used it quite a bit. So far so good, I love it. I'm a novice sewer who has been taking some classes at a local store (renting one of their higher-end machines). I decided on the Brother CS-6000I after a lot of research. This was within my price range and gets excellent reviews. I did notice that when I set it on a hard surface I have some of the tension issues that people talk about, but if I set it on a softer surface (carpet) I have no issues with the tension at all. I have sewn through thin cotton and knits as well as multiple layers of heavy denim. As long as I switch to the appropriate needle....no issues! I also fixed the crotch-seam in a pair of my step-sons work pants that are a heavy twill. The crotch had so many layers I didn't think this machine would be able to do it. But I switched to a 90 needle and gave it a try....no problem! So far this machine has been a little trooper and I love that it only weighs 13ish pounds....easy to carry.
From the picture, this looked much more of a finer yarn than it is. It turned out bulky and unuseable and was not soft at all. Disappointed.
We bought the Mehndi Henna Kit for our 13-year-old daughter for Christmas and are very disappointed in the product. Years ago, I had my hands hennaed with traditional designs while traveling in India, and we expected the kit to include stencils, examples, and instructions for those kinds of traditional designs--as is implied by the illustrations on the box itself. We also expected that the kit would contain some information about the culture and history of decorating the hands with henna. No such thing. The kit includes the raw materials and equipment for creating the designs. It does not include examples and instruction for creating traditional designs. Very disappointing!
These stained the grout in our tub. We tried, and tried, to ask our two kids to only draw on the tub. But, we looked away for a second and now our formerly white grout is a lovely pink.
The release to retract the blade for safe storage is a great idea. But it it's right where your thumb grips the tool so you'll be cutting and CLICK - blade retracted. Other than that design flaw the concept is great and the tool works perfectly. I've saved so much time cutting material over scissors.
Easy to use, great coverage, and stays on all day without smearing or bleeding. A huge step up from the cheapo face paints available at toy stores. Make sure you use appropriate tools -- sponges and brushes -- for the best possible application.
My daughter bought this yarn to start a knitting project. It is nice yarn, but it is a tiny skein and it had a LARGE price tag.Check prices elsewhere to avoid getting RIPPED off.
I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed when this toy first arrived. It looked less than impressive at first, but I wrapped it up and gave it to my duaghter for Christmas anyways. As my daughter has colored it, it has turned out to be cute. She has enjoyed coloring it and making it her own. Glad I chose to keep it now! She's really had a good time with it.
I love this machine! It's lightweight, which I love. It's easy to use and I am very happy with the results so far. One of the features that I really like is when you choose a stitch it automatically selects the stitch width and length that is appropriate for that stitch but you can still adjust it for your particular project.It's relatively inexpensive and I would recommend it for a beginner sewer or quilter.
I purchased these to use for clipping threads while sewing. I used them twice before putting them aside. They feel cheap, they don't cut well at all.Put your money towards a better pair of clippers....I think my toenail clippers would work better than these do.
It is a good product. It simply transfers your images from your computer to your machine. I would buy it again simply because I did not have another way of doing that at the time.
I received this machine as a birthday gift just over 2 years ago. I sew almost daily with this machine ranging from thin knits to denim (making jeans). As long as you keep your machine clean on the inside then you should never have any problems. About a year ago my machine started grinding and not sewing like the joints inside were stuck. I called to see how much it would cost to service it, $100 and a few weeks wait.. I decided I would open it up myself and if I couldn't figure it out then I would buy a new one since servicing would cost almost as much.I grabbed some q tips and rubbing alcohol. I opened the entire machine up so it was in 2 large pieces (you have to be careful as there are wires connecting the pieces). I began cleaning the lint off of everything! I thought I had gotten it all and tried my machine to see if it worked, it didn't. I went back in and tried to find something I missed. On the underside of where all the bobbin work is there were some rubber gears that had gunk on them, along with that gunk was a years worth of lint! I cleaned that up until it was all gone. Put my machine back together and whala! It ran better than I ever remembered.That is the only problem I have ever had with this machine. As long as you use the right feet and needles for the right material than this machine should last you years! I have recently received the Brother SE400 as a gift but I mainly only use it for embroidery since the cs6000i is my work horse.
I just started getting into the whole Chinese Calligraphy, and I may not have bought this from Amazon, but it was the only box left at a Chinese store in a mall. The brushes are indeed small, but are still good enough to hold, I'm a teenager and I was able to hold these well. The accessories are great to keep, but the bristles on the brushes are not the greatest. The key is to let the brushes dry vertically, and that is why the loops are at the end. It would be great if they had a Brush tree rack or whatnot, but I just use nail filer sticks resting over a counter ^^; Anyway, The Ink stick is REALLY REALLY weak. Very pretty, but again it's more for a beginners. I just used it for the first time tonight and I found it hard to get the ink to get dark. But at least I'm happy that I found a better way to get the accessories I needed.For people who wanted directions:The little cup on the right is for water, and there is a little spoon under the ink pad to scoop it out... hint, you need to tilt the cup in order to fill the spoon up.The little mountain shaped thing is a brush rest, so like if you needed new brush because the bristles are tired (that happens a lot it seems) you rest it there and etc.The stone and the other container on the left is a stamp that you would find on calligraphy murals with the red. This is your signature. You will need to carve your stone in order to do this correctly. I was told people can do it for you but I'm not sure how much it would cost.
This is a good quality airbrush kit for the money. easy to use and clean. Paint quality as good as a factory paint job on my model trains
I was very, very disappointed with this order. The wax came to me , not in a regular box just the wax in a brown packing box, I have no ideal if this is the wax that I ordered and paid for. I would never send someone a order like this. I do not recommend this seller to anyone. Very un- professional to say the least. I would never order from this seller again. I threw the wax in the garbage , no way could I use this not knowing what on earth it is and who made it.
This product probably would work great for an expert or someone with some experience in glass cutting. I had no experience with cutting glass and was trying to cut off the bottom of wine bottles for centerpieces at our wedding (have candles underneath). Anyway, it worked great for etching the glass like it was suppose to but with the thick wine bottles it was hard to keep a straight line and have a clean enough edge to sand down. It really just came down to my lack of experience or perhaps the application was trying to use it on.
I purchased this as a gift for my niece who is interested in learning to do needlework. I'm hopeful she be happy with it.
These are great scissors for left-handed people. My son is 15 and really needed these to help with his art. However, I am very upset that I just purchased them last week for $31 and now they are $18. I would like a refund for the difference! Anyway, see video of cutting with these scissors at: [...]
My husband is a geologist, I m interested in Petrology...these lenses are of great quality and the price is a bargain...my husband is also a astronomer and has made his own lenses...and was so impressed by the quality of these lenses that he has sort of taken ownership over them, might have to get another one for me.
I bought this item due to what other people stated in their feedbacks. I was more than excited to get this item and try it out. Unfortunately, the term "you get what you paid for" is so true. This is a piece of trash. I scored the tile and it took a lot of effort to break it. When it broke, it did so somewhat on the score mark but mostly not. It cracked diagonally making it impossible to try to break the rest of the tile off that didn't snap off as one piece. This was true for the glass as well. It just shattered the glass and broke it not on the score line. I even went over the score line a few times and that didn't help.I'm not sure what the 5-star folks were doing that I wasn't but I would pass on this one...or shell out the money to try the more expensive version.
I haven't really used it yet, but I am sure it will come in handy. I do plan to apply to doing my crafts.
This machine is packed with a lot of bells & whistles and looks promising at first glance, but when it comes to plain 'ol straight stitch, for some reason the machine can't handle it.I don't know if I just received a defective machine or if they're all like this, but it would not produce a healthy looking straight stitch. The thread kept looping on the reverse side of the fabric. I tried adjusting the tension to every available setting - didn't help. I changed the bobbin, I've rethreaded it numerous times, I even changed the needle. Nothing helped.Besides for not working properly, the machine is also made very cheaply.To open the bobbin door you have to tag on a little plastic catch which I'm sure will break in no time. The door itself is a thin piece of plastic that comes off the machine instead of sliding to the side. Every time you need to mess with the bobbin, you need to fit the door back in (that is if you don't loose it while it's off).I was very much looking forward to using this machine but it turned out to be a big disappointment and I will be returning it.
This is a good machine, I have had mine for 3 years, but you must not use a heavy weight thread. I piece quilts, & now after 3 years the tension is wearing out& was told by the repair shop that it would cost more than the machine is worth. So if you want a machine that will last a long time get a better one than this.
I bought a pair of these scissors in 1987, and they quickly became my favorites. They cut most anything I need (and yes, I tried chicken bones just to see), and they cut precisely and with almost no effort. They have remained excellent, sturdy, and sharp, and even though we have many newer pairs in the house, I still call these my "good scissors". I am tired of guarding them jealously to make sure my husband doesn't misplace them, so I finally decided to buy a couple more pairs; it will be nice to have a pair in some other rooms, because I tend to walk to the kitchen from everywhere in the house-- just to get my good scissors.
It does everything it's supposed to do and even sews through vinyl. Learned how to use the one-step buttonhole maker using the Singer bookThe New Sewing Essentials (Singer)and it works great. This was my first machine I purchased (at Wal-mart) and I have no regrets. It's a great starter machine.
It is easy to use and I recommend for beginners. This machine does all the basic functions you would ever need.
I bought this machine at walmart a few years ago and spent around $89 bucks at the time. Took it home and it worked great for awhile; soon enough the tension messed up. It became more an more frustrating to use. This is just for the basic sewer and is not really a machine that will last if you plan on using it everyday. Best for hemming or a little quilting now and then, its hard sewing through double thickness of denim and good luck sewing leather (even if you use machine needles for leather). Bottom line this is okay for a beginner or the occational sewer.
I was disappointed when I tried using these as they are too large for both my thread spools and bobbins.
As in prior reviews, my serger also arrived broken. The thread stand was screwed on too tight and snapped off during shipment. Still waiting for a replacement which is being sent using the same slow DHL to USPS method. Will hopefully arrive in one piece. Will amend this review if I ever receive a working product. :p
I purchased the Arnold Grummer medium kit a while back and have been using it without complication. I recently decided to purchase this large kit and am incredibly frustrated with it. The screen is not large enough, so you have to be INCREDIBLY careful about lining up the screen with the frame, and even then, the slightest agitation while in the water oftentimes causes the screen to crumple and slip out from under the frame. I live in a very small town and don't drive, otherwise I'd just go out and pick up a larger screen, but this kit isn't exactly cheap. No other purchases should be required.
Messed up areas on actual poster and bad medium for coloring which is the whole purpose. Took the longest to ship.
Great knife- will last a life time- made in the USA- strong blade- small and very sharp- great price for this knife!
Would have given this a 5 star but the pic showed it to be black and it was white and also amazon begged for this review...privacy ppl????
I am enjoying my new Janome Jem.. It is simple and easy to use right away. I have not had reouble with tge bobbins, the threading, etc and the stitches are even. Also, the directions are only in English and make sense, so the usual misdirections from multiple translations don't exist.
I purchased this leather hole punch tool to add some additional holes to a triple-stitched bison leather belt that is approximately 1/8" thick. The product works as advertised; however, the orange comfort grips are able to spin freely on the handles. I recommend punching the hole with the product, then keeping the handles pressed while rotating the unit side-to-side approximately 45-degrees to guarantee a clean cut.I had no problems with the unit successfully punching three new holes into my thick bison leather belt.
I was and am really happy with this purchase. I thought it was a little expensive but, the quality makes it well worth it. It is perfect for my traveling supplies and very sturdy, so I know it will get a great deal of use in the future. I took it on vacation and loved that it was compact and I was able to store my wet canvases without any damage at all.
I had a very expensive cashmere sweater that I wanted to change the color, I'll admit I was a little sceptical at first. I had never dyed anything with an acid dye before. It's quit a different process than regular dying,but I read the directions carefully and forged ahead It turned out amazing I now have a brand new sweater.
For years I've been repairing book covers and pages with regular Scotch tape, which as many know has a tendency to discolor, curl and lose its "stickiness" over time. But that was all that was available as far as I knew.As a book lover I'm delighted to have this tape made especially for books. The width is great and covers a multitude of tears (especially some jagged ones on favorite children's books.) Also like the transparency - recently repaired a dark green book jacket and the tape all but disappeared.What I don't have is a proper dispenser for this tape so I lose a little by folding over so it won't stick to itself. As far as I'm concerned that's a small price to pay for the tape my books have been waiting all their lives for.
very poor magnet, I would recomment only to attached a sheet of paper to the frig. I probably should have ordered a much thicker material
I work in a lot of prisma color pencils as well as other artist pencils and this is the VERY best paper that I have found to use...... I was told once that you are only as good as your tools..... I totally believe this! This paper is wonderful!! I very much recommend it to other artists!
I was really torn between buying this sewing machine and the more expensive name brand ones that are sold in sewing shops. I am very glad I purchased this one!I am a beginner sewer and this machine is perfect for me. It does everything I want/need it to do and even has a few little extras (the abiltiy to do sleves, the many stich designs). This machine has so far been wonderful for all of my projects. I have made a dress for my daughter, fixed a hamper bag, and made a spill matt for a high chair which required sweing through four layers of fabic. I love the eas of use and the ability to use the traditional foot pedal and also the modern sewing button.pros:-easily change out a needle-many, many stiches to choose from-buttom sewing stich - works amazingly!!-two ways to sew (foot pedal and button)-free arm to sew sleeves, etc.-easy threadingcons:-no embroidering ability-can be finiky with threads, need good quality and not the cheap stuff-is kind of heavy and the accompying case is not a carrying caseOverall, I think this is a great beginners machine (especially for the price) and one that will last me through years and many projects.
My machine broke down after only 8 month. I have broke countless needles and threads. You have to every careful with using the right setting and threads. It is also very noisy. It's probably a fine machine if you just want to do some basic sewing and repairing. Also, the warrenty is only 90 days for whole service, and 1 year for parts.
i used one packet for one 100% cotton t-shirt and followed the instructions. it died my finger black after 2 minutes exposure (hole in glove) but it barely made 5% difference to a cotton tee after an hour's exposure. my shirt is still grey. proof even more how weak it is, the white labels are still white. and now my tee smells like dye. maybe if i spent $100 on 20 packets for one t-shirt it would have worked how i wanted it to.
Received as ordered and promptly. However, packaging was poor and due to damage from mishandling, there was some product loss. Tubes of liquid need more that a kraft mailing envelope.
I ordered this box of 100 sheet protectors in February 2010 at a price about 30 percent off the retail value.The first two thirds of these were perfect.I have discovered (a year after I received them) that the last third of these (about 30 or so) are defective along the left seam, such that you cannot fit a regular sheet of paper inside them without creasing/wrinkling the page.So I guess you get what you pay for --when the product is significantly discounted. I paid about two-thirds of the retail price, and got about two-thirds of a box of fully-usable sheet protectors.I can still use these remaining defective-seam sheet protectors for items that are not 8.5 by 11 inches in size.If you are ordering a box of 100 of these sheet protectors because you need 100 of them for a special project, be wary that not all of them may fit regular sheets or paper.
I was given a slightly used Artista. Having 30 years potters experience, I got this one so I could travel around with it, being so light weight.I can throw on very primitive kick wheels, so the speed and the control knob were not a big issue for me. I did not get the legs or foot peddle. An experienced potter eventually gets a back ache and standing up solves that problem. So I put the Artista on a table. Stayed steady. worked fine.Then the belt starting slipping off the pulley. I had to borrow a phillips screw driver and remove 14 screws to put the belt back on. Then I stopped putting all the screws in because the belt slipped more and more and it was easier to fix without all those screws. The belt runs around a flat plastic pulley. I think they may have improved this, I see they advertise a V-belt, so the belt runs in a groove. This was a definite design flaw.But, on further consideration, I think the flaw originates in the fact that the short 3" or so metal shaft, sets into a metal bushing and that sets into the plastic of the frame. The use and the belt pulling on this bushing has tipped the shaft therefore the pulley and the belt slides off the plastic pulley wheel. The v-belt may solve this problem, but I worry that the new models are still pulling against plastic and eventually wear out the small motor and start the wheel wobbling. I cant get that far because I am giving up on trying to get the belt to stay on.I tried looking up the problem at the companies web site, no info. I looked for replacement parts, no info. I emailed the company twice and they never got back to me.I dont think I would buy one. I think I would rather invest in a treadle wheel. They are quiet, lighter than a weighted kick wheel. Speed and electric are not necessary to a good potter, unless you are a production potter, it is more important to have a wheel designed properly. The problem with pottery wheels, is that they are usually heavy and good ones cost.
I bought it to make myself a Urahara costume for halloween, it was very creative with a green nurse scrub and my black graduation toga. Price was a little Hi.
This product is ok..The only problem I have with it is that the front closure is velcro that is held on with hot glue and the first time that opened it the velcro came off..
There was pain crusted around the cap when I got this as if it had already been opened. Other than this the paint works well. It is also thick enough so it doesn't drip off paint brushes and make a mess with little artists.
I wanted them as a replacement for my xacto blades and they were not the same size. Before buying make sure you order the right size of blades you require. Overall the blades are sharp and plenty of them. Not a bad product at all.
A lot of people complain about Sakura's pens, and while Copics certainly have their advantages, Sakura's pens are great for the price, have very good ink and dry quickly with no smell. They also lay down easier than Copics, which is important to me because I hold pens strangely, and with Copics sometimes they won't lay down the ink. It's important however that you are very light with the touch on the pens, because the nibs can be flattened into the pen, making it useless. However, I like these pens!
I wasn't able to use it as the largest size in the variety pack is still too small for my coat. The larger (outdoor) kitZipper Rescue Kit-Heavy Duty might have worked.Therefore, cannot comment on this item usability.Be careful with the size you may need, although given lack of description on the item, it will still be a guesswork.
It's nice to sort your items, but the cover isn't made well. I actually have never found a organizer that closes perfectly and securely. :(
The product is the permanent glue sticks in the picture, Not repositionable like the title and product description states they are. The company was great about replacing them but after 4 tries, still not the item that was described. A+ on customer service, F on Product description.
I am NOT a sewer mainly fixing rips/tears, take in the inseam a bit, I had a SINGER given to me by a friend YEARS AGO. It started NOT sewing like it use to so I WAS going to buy a BROTHER at OVERSTOCK.COM, but went to a LOCAL Target store instead and seen the SHARK INTELLI-SEW, so I thought well what the hec, I can make curtains, etc., do monograms. Well I GUESS I NEED some type of hoop for that, because when I tried to make an "L" it SO DID NOT come out right, I know part of the problem is me, but I think the instructions for the settings & the hoop could have been a little better, easier for a BEGINNER like myself to understand. Other than that once I FIGURED OUT the AUTO NEEDLE THREADER it worked great. I know that with time & practice I will learn ALOT MORE with this machine. I am satified with my purchase.
I didnt like this at all puch comes out really badI might as well use my drill to make the hole
I was just starting out as a sewer so I got this machine becasue it "appeared" to do a lot for the money. It is ok as far how it works its nice to have the all the stitches but it is very load sounds like it is breaking (in fact I thougth it was and it was just a bad machine until I heard that is common with brothers) it also DOES NOT EMBROIDERY... do not believe that. also you cant really go past med speed or it starts acting up. look else were because in 6 months you will be better then the machine can do.
These do what they say. They are great for kids who love to paint. We used them all summer but they won't last for another season. The sponge isn't extremely thick and you can't expect it to last on the stick after using, washing and drying. It eventually is too much wear. I'm sure we'll buy these or something else similar again to replace the ones we have. We need something beyond brushes. We paint weekly outside in the summer.
I use this tape just like I use regular Scotch tape to mail packages. It doesn't seem any thicker or harder to cut or tear than regular tape. I just personally did not see the difference between this tape and regular Scotch mailing tape.
This looked handy & fun so we thought we'd give it a try.Bad choice.The throat (distance you can punch from the edge of the paper) is only 1/8" -- which complicates positioning since you have to trim one edge within +/- 1/16" before punching -- so much for most of the advantage of positioning face up.The mechanism is also not very sturdy, and jammed trying to do moderately heavy card stock. With some effort and perseverance, we got it unjammed again, but phooey.The Paper Shapers punch we switched to is almost as easy to use punch-side up (though it wasn't made to be used that way), has a 3/4" throat (six times larger), for much, much easier positioning, and is much, much sturdier, going through the same piece of card stock with ease.The squeeze design is a fun gimmick, and we wouldn't discourage you from trying one, but choose a pattern purely for play value and get something else for serious use.
I don't really know what to compare this particular mannequin to except for solid- state, non-adjustable dress forms. In my opinion however, I feel as though this is a pretty cheap product. I've had it for about three months. I only plan on using it a few times a month or even less. It works just fine, and has been great for what I need. Nevertheless, I don't imagine that it will last long, especially if I'm not extra careful when handling it. It is the perfect size for anyone who needs to make clothes sized 4-6 (in REAL sizes by measurements, not the euphemistic USA sizing where the label says 6 but the measurements are really more like an 8 or a 10). An 8 might be a tough size to expand this mannequin to, and I don't think when in its default size it is much smaller than a 4.The casing fabric is nice; fabrics stick to the surface, which I find helpful. You can also easily stick pins into it. So far, I haven't had any problems and it works just fine for what I need. I would stray away from this model if you use a lot of heavy fabrics because the mannequin will slowly sink down the main pole with too much weight, or if you're going to demand a lot from your mannequin.I would recommend this mannequin as a perfect starter dress form for someone who is beginning to sew clothes simply because of its affordable price. However, I would not recommend this dress form for anyone who needs something really stable, well-built, and/or professional quality.
I love it! So easy to have everything located in one bag that I use for scrapbooking. Has rollers so its easier to get around when I go to friends houses to scrapbook.
I've owned this for about two weeks. And have used it almost everyday. There are some things I like alot, like, the super easy bobbin design, the easy threading. But it is extrememly light. It will easily tip over. It struggle through two layers of fleece, and jammed up over a seam. As I was pulling the fleece through, it tiped over. It's probably great for light weight sewing, but with four boys, I need something that can handle denim and heavy material. The work space is also very small, don't even think that you'll get a quilt or jacket through there!
Hard to adjust - and the paper guide (silver metal slider) can be bumped and misaligned way too easily. It seems quite cheap.
I initially looked for a mat locally to avoid paying shipping. Couldn't find one in the 24 x 36 size anywhere, and it was too expensive to order that size online. So I ordered this mat instead. Wouldn't you know it, shortly after the mat arrived, Walmart got the larger sized mat in ... and it only cost $27. If you don't have a Walmart nearby, this might be your best buy. If you do, check there first!
As the title says this is a low grade construction paper. I found it to be a bit flimsy and a dark gray, rather than black. The price is right for throw away student projects.
I ordered white and was shipped yellow... I could get the yellow trace easily in my area... the whole point was getting it in white. Returning it was not an option.I will not be ordering from this distributor again.
I've tried a variety of different kinds of colored pencils overtime including derwent and faber castell and although these pencils are good too, I believe Prismacolored pencils are certainly the best ones on the market. These pencils with their soft leads are easier to blend then the two brands and don't come off as easy if you accidently rub your hand on your work (very important to me). They come in a lot of different sizes (12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120) and the price tag is always quite high for colored pencils but it is something you won't regret buying. The only flaw I can tell about them is sometimes I get a pencil with flawed wood, and it just won't sharpen! I usually lose a lot of this pencil to sharpening but I manage. (this is rare) Highly recommended to everyone who loves to draw!
The product was ok, it just seemed a bit expensive. The stencil performed as expected with crisp edges. It was borderline too thin as it allowed some paint to blow under.
This is a really neat technique that I've yet to try. I am constantly adding to my polymer clay book collection and this was the only one I found on the uses of liquid clay. Very good instructions and lots of ideas in here. The liquid clay is something anyone can make themselves in the colors you want.Great used book too. I was very, very pleased.
For the money, the is a fairly decent magnifying glass. Don't really expect it to be thirty power, though. It is more or less ten power as far as I can figure by comparing it to several expensive Hastings triplets I own.Where they got the "approximately 30x" from is anyone's guess unless they were trying to rate the thing by area magnification as opposed to linear magnification. In this case they got the formula wrong.Magnifiers are usually rate linearly, in that a 2x magnifier should make a one inch line appear two inches. This is the same as binoculars and other magnifying instruments though there is some kind of convention, I believe, of a standard ten inches with reading glass magnifiers.Whatever--the thing does have glass lenses as far as I can tell and it comes in a nifty little plastic box. It is a great little lens for a geology student or a nature buff and, at the price, makes a novel little gift.
My review is two fold. I like the quality of the photos from my picturemate. However I've ordered the T5845 cartridge twice, both times I only was able to print 50 photos no where near the 100 advertised. That over $.60 per photo.
One star rating because the kit contained the wrong airbrush:I was excited to try out this airbush (Badger 200-20 Detail) as I'd read some great reviews on it and Badger has a great reputation. Unfortunately when the airbrush kit arrived today, it had the wrong airbrush in it. As you can see from the picture, it has the Vega Nailaire airbrush instead of the 200 Detail. This is obviously incorrect as some of the parts included in the kit won't work with this airbrush. I contacted Amazon and they were very helpful however this product is out of stock so I was unable to get a replacement. I ordered a different 200 Detail kit (from Amazon) and they were good enough to expedite the shipping so hopefully I'll have a more positive review tomorrow.
Decent for the price. Not sold on it being able to keep up with the big name players but for what I paid, I cant complain
My new favorite medium. I also bought a small squeeze bottle so I can simply squeeze a drop or two into my pile of paint. No mess and no waste!
The desk comes in two pieces the frame and the table top. There are no pre-drilled holes for the table top so putting the desk together requires making measurements on the table top, and then trying to set the frame up so that it is relatively easy to connect to the table. The table top is made of particle board and the paint or enamel coating is pretty easily scuffed or cracked. folding the table to put it away may require adjusting the height of the frame so that the desk folds "neatly." I'm not sure that I would recommend this desk for anyone who wants to do serious drafting work on it, but for the price its a decent sized desk which with some effort can be folded out of the way.
Not good paint. Very thick. Resembles marshmallow cream. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I needed something a lot smoother and thinner.
I got the white reflective stickers, and they are bright, but they aren't "stickons," as in individual pieces. It's a long line of tape, and you can cut them into pieces or smaller, but it's messy and hard to do, the stickers stick to the scissors or fall on the floor. Also, the adhesive was weak and it took a lot of effort to get them to stick. I wouldn't buy them again.
I've used this thing for about 6 months. I bought it with the optional converter, which is really a must, as Rotring's cartridge ink stinks. I use it with waterproof Speedball SuperBlack, and it rarely clogs, but when it does, it starts flowing quickly if you just rinse the tip. It's a good idea to clean this with Rapido-eze pen cleaner once in a while like a Rapidograph.That said, this pen will not give you the kind of line differentiation as a crowquill, (Hunt or Speedball 102) and other reviewers were correct in saying this pen is stiff. The thinnest line is still pretty fat compared to a crowquill, but it dumps ink and doesn't cut the paper.EDIT: I downgraded this to three stars, after a few months of use I just find this too big a pain to clean properly and there's just not enough line variation when applying different pressures. It's fast and rarely skips, but for what I use it for I'd just prefer a fat Rapidograph.
Does not come with the handle as stated in the product page. And though there are 6 cutting tools in the photo there are only 5 that come in the box.
I bought this table 3 years ago for my then 2yr.old grandson. Add 3 yrs. + 2 more children...and the table is still sturdy. The chairs have also withstood much use (and abuse?). RECOMMEND. !
I ran out of 2 colors and called the company. They said they would send more 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting.
Purchased this punch in March. Great initially. Now one of the holes doesn'tpunch all the way through and it's necessary to remove the punches from insideall three holes. I feel it should be funtioning well after eight months, sonow I wouldn't recommend it if you do a lot of punching.
I bought this set knowing that the stamp pads came dry per other reviews, so I wasn't too surprised when mine was dry too. I bought other stamp pads to go with it but I'm still disappointed that a big company like M&D; can't somehow keep their stamp pads wet.The stamps themselves are nice. They're solid wood and rubber so durable. The pictures stamp pretty well.I found the 'storage box' to be a waste of time since there is no lid. We ended up just storing all of ours in a shoe box.Overall worth the $10... If I had paid any more than that I probably would have been a little more upset.
Was very excited to open the box today when it arrived. The color is great; however, I was immediately disappointed that a $47 organizer would have such thin, cheap shelves. Ultimately, I had to return it, because the joints were not totally secure or aligned. The light interior of wood looked awful when exposed due to the poor carpentry.
I turned blue in the face trying to punch out one flower! Lining it up on a small area is difficult too (I cut a few bookmarks with my Cricut and wanted to try a simple flower on top of each). I even tried to use it on flimsy paper, but failed. I never used punches before, but this will be my first and last one from this company. If I can, I'll return it to Michael's for a refund. I should have taken a hint from the many previously opened and taped up Punches they had hanging on the wall.If I had a 250-pound tackle from the NFL to press this thing for me, then I'd have it made! However, my measly efforts resulted in only frustration and a sore hand.I admire the one reviewer who said he was able to use it!
These stamps are great. Stamps are a great art projects for kids to do since it's not as messy as paint or other projects. These stamps are excellent quality. I love that it even comes with some colored pencils to enhance the stamp. Kids will love to put stamps on envelopes, homework, and whatever else you can think of.
I needed these scissors not for embroidery but for HO-scale fine modeling work. They are exactly what I wanted, except that because my thumb is a lot bigger than those of most ladies using the scissors for embroidery, to have any control I have to jam it into the loop so hard that it quickly becomes rather painful. The only solution I can think of is to cut the loop at the back and spread it open far enough to accommodate my thumb. It would be nice to have scissors like this available that are better suited for men.
I thought that I would embroider the whole picture. But it turned out, that only some flowers and the bird are left for embroidery, there is nothing to do with the rest of the picture
Because of the usability and price, this product is ok despite one odd thing about it. The sliding steel arm is set to measure in the wrong direction. It's almost like the original picture (but they've since changed the photo) except the numbers are on the other side and facing in the other direction. The arm that I got was meant to be inserted on the other side. Even the tilt of the upper arm runs in the opposite direction. I've showed others and nobody has seen anything like it before. But it doesn't mean anything. The functionality is not changed at all. I wonder if this oddity is what resulted in this item being cheaper.
We purchased the sewing machine for our 11 year old granddaughter who had it on her wish list for Christmas. When visiting her in Buffalo, it only took a short time before she was sewing on her own. She was able to create gifts for her family.(pillows, make-up purse)without any problem. Threading the machine and bobbin was made quite easy by good instructions. I would highly recommend this machine for many sewing projects and for any age level.
This kit would be fantastic for a casual adventure in flame working - in other words, for someone not looking to seriously invest in the craft. I intend to seriously invest in the craft and bought the kit at the recommendation of a friend. However, you don't get much bang for the buck - shabby, dirty and downright cheap tools, plus glass of questionable quality.The torch head that came with the kit has already begun to show damage, at no fault of my own. I have only put in about ten hours of work, at the settings specified by the directions on the box. The fireproof work station is a joke; it's merely a thin layer of fire-resistant material with a cheap cardboard backing. On a positive note, the bead release seems to be alright, and almost all the instances in which I have lost a bead on the mandrel have been the result of my mistakes.The few glass rods that came with the kit were dirty and several of them had small cracks in them at the time of arrival. Not to mention, little consideration seemed to be given to the skill level of the buyer when the rods were chosen. I received only one stick of black and white, and had several sticks of clear, plus strange hybrid colors which one would not expect to see in a beginner's pack of glass.Diamond Tech, not the company I purchased the product from, is to be given a poor review for this product. There is something positive to be said: this product is great for a very brief, curious experiment in glass. For more serious interests, it would be wiser to buy the components individually or as a kit from another website:A hothead torch, which like the Diamond Tech self-igniting torch can be used with MAPP gas, costs between thirty five to forty dollars new. You can also buy adapters to fit bulk propane tanks and save lots of cash.Glass rods can be purchased from many sites for very reasonable prices, by the stick or in bulk. Howaco Glass, for instance, sells many rods at 50 cents and up.I have already used up several rods from my kit, so I'll assume there were about ten rods included - five dollars at the cheapest, more for elaborate colors.The other components are rather cheap and easy to find. The most difficult thing to find would be a cheap marver, although the marvers provided are little more than shaped hunks of aluminum. (I use the flat side, anyway.) More expensive equivalents of the items provided would last longer, as well - I am already looking to replace the torch, and I have the feeling the work station will be the next to go.This kit is not all bad! But if you're really looking to get into bead making, invest in more permanent, quality supplies.
The Helping hands is a pretty awesome tool. I saw this thing on an online video and thought they looked cool and would help with my painting projects and purchased it from amazon, its even cooler in person. My only issue is that I wish it had extra clamps, but I guess I can purchase the claps seperately.
I usually like OXO products but this one is terrible. They are awkward, not sharp, and the spring mechanism doesn't work most times. After you make one cut you have to use both hands to pull the blades apart. Useless for cutting up chicken.
Junk - Package was stapled shut when I recieved it. Blue case hinge was broken and the latch looked like it had been chewed on by a small dog. Wouldnt close at all leaving blades exposed. Blades are not secure in the handles, they shift if any pressure is applied. If you plan to use these on the regular; save yourself the headache and spend $20.00 on the brand name set.
I had ordered this based on a few reviews i saw, but when I used it to dye a sweater I've had for 10 years it did not work. Bought another brand of dye and it worked great on the same sweater. And i followed the directions to a t. So i do not recommend this product.
The 1" square punch actually creates a square that fits inside a 1.5" diameter circle. This means the square is more like 1.06066017 inches. (Diameter of the circle is 1.5 inches. If you put a square in the circle, the diagonal line across the square is 1.5", creating a triangle with a 1.5" hypotenuse and unknown size of each side. A squared plus B squared = C squared. if A=B, you get 2A^2=1.5^2. It's easy to solve from there...)It doesn't matter a lot, except if you are creating squares that you want to fit into a larger project - like cover a certain size surface. As you put square next to square, the difference adds up surprisingly quickly!
I thought I Was getting a deal with this price but it was actually me spendij g more for such little beads. Crafts store was cheaper. Wish I could return but its such a hassle.
I want you to notice you that the pencils are made in Mexico. There is no extra bonus in the tin box. I never use the pencils made in USA, so I have no idea whether their quality has gone down. The things I am sure that the product is not made in USA. Amazon doesn't sell things exactly the same as its website said!! I feel really bad about it!
I bought this to put a collage of all of my wedding events into one place. I had never done anything like this so I was nervous. Well when I got it I was supprised by they effecientness of the book, and how easy it was to use. It is definately a great book for beginners and above.
I purchase this in 2007 directly from Amazon. It cost $4 back then. It came within a week with free super saving shipping (which is basically standard shipping). The stickers are made of high quality material. It is bigger than it looks in the picture, which I was very pleased with. I used my stickers for a scrapbook page. The stickers are also amazingly detailed, which I was very happy about.These are dimensional stickers, which means that they have texture to them and you can actually feel them, just like embellishments - these aren't printed stickers on a sticker sheet (which is why they cost more).I only gave it three stars because it is very pricey. I buy lots of Jolee stickers (they are the best in their industry), and they have other stickers that cost the same amount that is a lot nicer than this - which is basically a small thanksgiving wreath and nothing else. I was kind of disappointed with this one.
Ordered just before Christmas, but did not use until Feb to convert a pair of pants to shorts. No problems, was impressed with the needle threading option and being able to sew without a pedal.In April I decided to make a small 42x42 chenille quilt which uses a thickness of 1 cotton and 3 layers of flannel fabric. I finished about 1/8 of the project and the machine started making a clunking noise. I called Brother and they listened to the noise over the phone. They advised to keep using it and that 'sewing machines make noise' I advised it sounded like the gears were missing but I took their advice, the machine quit completely shortly after. Brothers advice then was to go to the nearest repair center which was about an hour away. I was not able to achieve this until Jul 7. Two weeks later I rec'd a call they had ordered parts and it would take 2 weeks. The beginning of Aug I rec'd another call a part was on back order, it would take another few weeks but they would call me. Sept 16 I was going to be in the area so I called them and miraculously it was ready and 'they were just about to call' From their work order it shows the machine was ready on the 8th, 2 months total in the shop. 2 weeks later I had an opportunity to work on my project. I sewed only 2 seams and the machine failed again. This was after they had replaced the motor, shaft and timing belt. The repair center refused to accept the machine, stating they had lost money and they felt the machine un-repairable. They called Brother who advised them to tell me to call for an RA to have the machine replaced. I called and they authorized a 'repair authorization' and I had to pay the shipping to return the un-fixable machine. The also said they would be repairing the machine not replacing as that is their policy. They did advise the turnaround time once in their hands was 8-10 days depending on the repair of course. So long story short, I think UPS dropped the machine or it is just a lemon and I wasted a lot of time and a bit of money for not much sewing. I had to call Brother as the RA did not arrive in my mailbox as they mis-typed my email. Long story short if the machine worked longer than an hour it would be a great machine with excellent accessories. Brother is not a responsive company and I have now ordered a Juki.. hopefully the Japanese have a more solid product.
bought this for my mother-n-law. thought it was going to be bigger than it was. took my only 3 days to finish it. would recomend for someone who is learning to cross stitch but wouldn't suggest for someone looking for a challenge.
Good luck getting this bed! I ordered it 5 months ago (with availability being 2-4 weeks. Each month I was told it will available "next month." I finally cancelled my order and purchased the Little Tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed.Kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill.
While being an ok magnifier, this is most definatley NOT a 30x magnifier, its much more like 10x, so that being said I cannot give this a good review because the item is not as described.BEWARE, if you are looking for a 30x magnifier this is not for you, however, if a 10x will do than this would be a fine buy.
These all-plastic scissors can't cut construction paper. Even while working really slowly and carefully, they rip the paper and the result is unsightly. It didn't handle normal paper that well either. I should have put a few extra dollars and gotten something metallic.
really,all this is is packing tape that I could have gotten at walmart or anywhere for alot cjeaper price!! not a good purchase!
I like this, but I would like to see more color variety for the packs. and more basic colors. so far easy to use.
The two skeins of yarn didn't match, and there were knots and unevenness such as loopsin the skein I used.
Because the title says prep protector I thought this was the clear gesso, it's not. Don't be fooled, it's regular white gesso.
My anxious son wanted to see the final product but it took over 2 weeks to complete. It was way too long for a 6 year old to wait. The final product was beautiful but several steps must be taken to get there.
I love this thing! I do not own a regular sized sewing machine. It is all I have. I have sewn drapes, hemmed pants, and have made lots of pillows. I haven't found anything wrong with its mechanical capabilities. Like I said, I do not have a regular machine, so I can't really compare. But I am still suprised that the stitches are as tight as they are and my projects have come out beautifully. It was worth every penny for me.
There is a slight alignment issue where the bars lock together. Some corners are flush, some are mis-aligned by about 1mm. I had to use a sand paper to smooth it out. If you don't have sand paper, a knife will work too, because pine wood is pretty soft.Other than that, the bars are decently sturdy. They are about 1/8 inch thicker than the ones I bought from a local Micheals store (which don't have alignment problem).It's important to put glue into where the bars lock together to prevent shifts. For larger sizes, I also put a few staples into the corners to improve structural rigidity.The size is standard. For example, 24x36 size will fit into a 24x36 frame with some slack, and after stretching a canvas on it, the whole thing will fit snugly into the frame. It protrudes about 1/4 inch to the back of the frame, so you'll need 1/4 inch offset clips to secure it.
The etching cream works good. Make sure your stencil is an adhesive one, to make sure you only get the etch cream where it should go. I put masking tape around the stencils, to make sure the cream didn't get anywhere else.The etching is light. I used small stencils, so the etching is sublte. I might stick out more if the stencils were bigger. Made a nice gift. I etched a glass dish with someone's name.
I bought this paper for a classroom project. The paper color was almost exactly the color that is shown here. I appreciate that the image was an excellent representation of the actual product.
The order arrived quicker than expected and the detailed packing impressed me. Though the colors were repeated and some were short in count and some looked really fake. Over all, good quantity but not quality. Would think twice if I had to buy it next time.
This is nice for baby blankets. It can split and I do like something with a cotton content a bit better but you do not have to worry about wool allergies with this yarn and the colors are great.
the 3/4 Flat Wash Brush sheds too much for me to use it. I hate picking hair off of my paper with tweezers. The others brushes are fine, but ~$50 is far too much for four small brushes of average quality for sable.
This machine is cheaply made and not worth the money. I got rid of it after using for only 2 months. I don't recommend.
Ordered this for a Christmas gift but it looks to me like it will be a great gift under the tree!
you get what you pay for on this one. i don't think its a piece of junk, but it's not super great either. i used it to transfer a chevron image onto a wall, then to paint over. its hard to move this and get the exact image again.
Sumi-E painting set. I would call it more of a traveling kit because it is so small. I had never tried sumi-e before, and now that I have started, I realize it is easier to do with a much larger, thicker brush than the ones provided in this kit. Also, though grinding the ink is interesting in a meditative, old world sort of way, using black watercolor paint is quicker and easier. Still, I like the way this set is made, and it does make a lovely gift. As for the seller, shipping, et al, it was A+ all the way.
We are planning a family reunion. These colorful goodie bags will be given to each family member as they enter the door.
just got the patch and it looks just like the picture. The shippment was quick and I am very happy with what I got, I might end up ordering another one soon
This product did not arrive new. It came with refilled ink. The Epson photo cartridges have ink that is archival and fade resistant. I can't be sure that the ink that was refilled in this cartridge was the quality of the ink that Epson uses. I was VERY disappointed. There was no time to return as my family was just about to leave on a vacation where we were taking the printer (and cartridge) to a family memeber's house. We had many pictures to print, and we had to use the faulty cartridge.
I've had this unit for about 6 weeks and it worked well until a head broke today. I called the company thinking that 6 weeks was a little premature and they told me that the unit has a lifetime warranty on everything except the head and that the heads that cost $53.59 for a set of 3 should be replaced approximately every 100 punches. Had I known that I would not have purchased this unit. That is a very considerable addition to the cost of printing that was not disclosed anywhere pre-purchase. Furthermore, $53.59 is crazy, I was expecting them to say $6 or $7 for a set of 3. Yes when it's not broken it works fine, but they need to be more honest about the cost of operating this unit. Had it said anything about that in the description I'd give the unit a 5 but since they ignore it and pretend it isn't an issue they get a 2 and I really should give it a 1.
The brushes and everything else are super tiny, only a child's hand can hold those. Not a good set at all. Rather just go to micheal's art store and get the sumi set there. Just stay away from this set, unless you you buy this as a gift for your 3 years old child.
This heavy duty adjustable punch was just what we needed. But when it arrived, we found that two of the 3 punches did not go all the way through the holes, so it would only punch one hole. We looked it over carefully, even took it to a stationery store, to see if it could be adjusted, to no avail. The seller refunded our money along with the shipping costs.
I have to admit right off that I am not an experienced serger, but I do have good sewing experience. This machine has been such a nightmare for me!!!! I was so excited to get my first serger, but I am having nothing but problems and have not been able to finish one single thing. ARG! It threaded pretty easily with clear color-coded instructions but nothing else has worked. Three needles have broken, one bent (I'm only sewing flannel here!). Now I am out of needles and as others have mentioned, they aren't easy to find. I will have to order new neddles online which is fine with me at the moment as I could use the week long break from this frustating machine! I'll give it one more go when the new needles arrive, and perhaps a trip to the 'local' singer dealer 35 miles miles away, but I may be returning this machiine.
I bought this for an 8 year old for a birthday gift, I always love crafts and thought it would be good for a rainy day. It is great for the price and the quality if pretty good. The only downfall is that we went through these crafts pretty quick. There is another set similar to this that looks to be a but harder but looks good none the less. For the price and contents this is a good project to keep an 8 year old occupied for a few hours!
This brush is a wonderful addition for any type of artist. Especially good for the watercolorist. The ability to control your strokes and amount of water is wonderful.
I used this serger heavily for about a year. As time progressed, it seemed like the tension was getting weaker and weaker and I had to keep adjusting it up. Then, while I was changing the needles, the needle clamp broke. All I did was try to tighten the clamp with the little hex wench and it snapped into pieces. It's made of cheap (and brittle) plastic. I tried to remove the needle thread guide (the metal piece that wraps around the needle bar) to get a better look at what was broken. The screw that holds the thread guide in place is made of cheap soft metal and was almost impossible to remove without stripping. I ended up having to buying a new needle clamp online (still waiting for it to arrive) and a new screw (for the thread guide) from the hardware store.
I was VERY disappointed with my purchase of the Wiss scissors. They are soooo tight, it's nearly impossible to get them open to cut anything. I wanted to return them but I didn't want to go through all the hassle Amazon requires. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!
I read the other reviews, but chose to take a chance, since I'd had such good luck with other Art Alternative products, and the little case looked handy. That was a mistake. While the little case is handy and portable, these things are too pale and watery to be worth the trouble. I would not recommend buying them.
GREAT markers! Though 1 did come completely dried out, still great to work with for art projects
The handle was uncomfortable to hold while punching papers, and after a little over a month of moderate use in my classroom (by myself only - students did not touch it) the handle bent and eventually broke off! Now it's essentially useless because the broken metal handle is uncomfortable to hold onto. I contacted the manufacturer a few days ago and have not heard back. Since it's past Amazon's month-long return window, it was a waste of $25.
Doesn't feather, with a sharp, crisp, dense line. Slow dries on quality paper where it tends to sit on top rather than be quickly absorbed (cheaper paper). But where it fails as a drawing ink is that it lightly lifts when a wash of water is applied. Even lightly will kill a watercolor or colored ink wash. As long as you don't care about it being absolutely waterproof, this is a great ink, but if you require absolute waterPROOF (as opposed to water "resistant"), then this is NOT the ink you want.
to big for sewing machine. This is advertised to work with the Brother machine and it fit inside case but case is way to big for machine
I too purchased this machine with great trepidation. I've had my White for almost 15 years which I love dearly. I decided to try the Singer because the cover stitch would be (I thought) a real time-saver.Well, aside from the other comments above, I do not like the fact that there are no numbers for tension adjustment - you just "guess" - maybe I'm too picky but I like to have my tension exact so I get a good solid stitch. My White tells you what the tension should be for each needle and looper for the different stitches.Secondly, I do not like the fact that I cannot access the left side of the machine. I finally figured out the lever system that threads the loopers that are not visible, but I found myself very leery of this system since if something goes wrong, well, who knows? You can't see inside. Plus, how can you really get the lint out of that area?In addition, every time I changed the plastic plate for cover stitch or to use the knife, I felt like any one of the tabs (on the plastic covers) was going to break off!Anyway, I returned it because I just couldn't see paying $600 for one stitch - the cover stitch.Wouldn't it be nice if someone would make a dedicated cover stitch machine at around $200? Or if you could add the pieces to make your existing serger have the cover stitch as an attachment? They do it on embroidery machines, so why not sergers?I just think Singer could have done a better job - more professional, more informative (as others have said - no CD or video), and sturdier.
Absolutely love it. It was an upgrade for me from a White serger of 1987. It is much, much easier to thread, and the knife can be moved without having to take it apart - there are a couple extra feet for it, the adjustments are easy to make, almost as easy as a sewing machine - the industry has definitely come a long way and this is a delightful improvement - and the price was quite agreeable as well.I chose to get it from Amazon because of their stand by the buyer policy in making sure the purchase went well, you got what it was you ordered, and that you are happy with it.
I saw a video of how to use this product on Nancy's Notions website. She made it look so easy--just tamp the applicator in the tray that comes with it, rub it over the stencil and there is your sewing line all ready to be quilted. Unfortunately it didn't work that way for me. You have to tamp the pad a lot to get the powder to work its way though the pad and it did not come through evenly even though I tried to shake the powder around to make sure it covered the whole pad. Then after I swiped it over the stencil the line was not very distinct--it had a halo around the lines. The part that really bothered me though was that the line rubbed off before I had it quilted. Just with the movement necessary to move the piece around while stitching caused enough movement to rub the chalk marks off. I don't know if there is a way to make the powder stick to the fabric better. I would not buy this product again.
I was thrilled to have purchased this loom set just a couple of days ago at Michael's using my 40% off coupon for a total of $12!!! I am an avid knitter and recently stumbled onto loom knitting as my 5 year old daughter received a small kid's loom over the holiday weekend and I could not put it down!!! The only bad thing I have noticed so far is the severe lack of proper instructions included with the set. I spent all day trying to figure out how to make some basic stitches (knit, purl, etc.) to no avail. Even my mother who has been knitting and crocheting since she was a teenager was annoyed and confused with the instruction guide. The only good thing about the directions included is that they had nice pictures, but only included directions for a scarf. I would have thought from the outside of the package that there would have been more a more comprehensive booklet included. There are patterns and instructions on the provocraft site, but nothing with any kind of pictures and very limited information for someone who is new to the craft of looming.Needless to say, I was very frustrated by this evening and was debating whether or not to take the set back. I am glad I did not as I just spent the last couple of hours watching some great Youtube videos including one must see video with Isela Phelps, located at [...], which goes step-by-step through all the basics (casting on, basic stitches and casting off) to which I have already made a sample swatch of all these techniques for quick reference in the future. Isela Phelps has 4 books listed here on Amazon. I am getting ready to order, "Loom Knitting Primer: A Beginner's Guide to Knitting on a Loom with over 30 Fun Projects". From all the reviews I have seen online, this books seems to get high marks for beginners. She also has a website, [...], and blog which I will be following closely for more info as I get going with this whole looming thing! Had I not found this resource, I would be returning the set.
This tube is very good for the price. The fact that it extends from 2 feet to 3 is a really nice feature. It is also pretty durable, and is EXTREMELY helpful when it's raining.
i like fountain pens this one is nice i have many friends that saw me using it and wanted to try it. they deemed it the snazzy pen
These are really adaptable kitchen scissors. For us, that means these are the "everything" scissors that are used for general kitchen use, paper & light cardboard, opening packages, and just about anything else you wouldn't grab a job-specific cutting tool for. We even use them as box cutters, popping them apart and using just one side. About the only thing we don't use them for in the kitchen is as poultry shears. They aren't heavy-duty enough for that. They are perfect as general-use scissors, but do not replace heavy shears, fine shears and thread nippers, sewing scissors, etc. They would be a good substitute for most office scissors, however.The blades are tough and stay sharp for years. Because they are stainless and pop apart so easily, they get tossed into the dishwasher all the time, especially after opening packages containing raw foods.We're on our second pair. The only problem we've ever had, and the reason for the replacement, is that we somehow managed to break the plastic handle on our first pair. I don't remember how, as that was several years ago. As an interesting testament to these scissors, we've kept and continue to use the old pair also!
Everything arrived promptly and as described/shown. The seller charging for shipping on something that was post-marked under a dollar didn't sit too well though. Other than that, these do the job I need them to. I'll post again if the extenders or my skin turn green! For the price, not bad. I would love to find these in 10K or 14K gold for a reasonable price, but these will due for now.
Good Cutter for that price, very handy and useful, it is make easy a lot of stuff, a lot better than other ones
I was so excited and I thought it was a middle price..it appeared to get ok reviews for over 30.00 you think it would at least get the job done. It looked like it was splitting in half..the black part the lense falls off/not attached. Don't know what to order next that is affordable.
Comes with a variety of useful bits, all very sharp and easy to work with. They fit into the handles easily and were able to handle simple cuts with ease.Case was a little disappointing. Seems that was where the lack of care and thought into creating a quality product. The plastic is heavy enough, but the clip is very hard to close and you feel as if you may break the box shutting it. The magnet inside for the bits is a real nice touch, and each blade has a template to fit in to keep from moving around. This is adequate but not the best use since some of the templates do not exactly contour to each bit. Overall, nice buy, and already paid for itself.
I was very pleased with this product. It basically looks like clear packing tape, however I was pleasantly surprised with how heavy it was. I also liked that it was clear. Generally when I think of book tape, I think of the thick, colored stuff that librarians use. This was heavy, not with that type of texture, but was clear so it allowed you to see the book. I liked that.
So far, I like this cutting mat. It has plenty of guide lines on it. I used my last mat for 20 years, so I am expecting the same performance from this one, I'll get back to you in 20 years.
I really think that was a good choise ,,,,,It comes with the basic thing that usually we need...easy to use and pretty ligthweight.
Neodymium-Iron-Boron rare earth magnet: 1/4 cylinder... Unfortunately, the north and south poles are through a *diameter* of the cylinder. This means you cannot put two of them on a wire or thin rod and have them "float". Instead they will spin, align north to south and south to north at the circumference, and snap together. The result is a long "rod" of magnets. This makes them stick to the fridge better, and since there is a hole, you could put a loop of string through it. But these are not so great for those "perpetual motion" machines you know you are thinking about right now.
This product will not work on trousers. It was received on time. I thought I had ordered the product and a refill, but received two products instead.
When I first learned how to crochet yarn was cheap since that time the price has risen for a number of reason. I never expected the price to escalate to what it is now. Paying such an exhorbant price I never thought that I would have to constantly cut knots aloose and reattach them.
Good product at a good price without the hassle of going from store to store trying to find the best hole punch. It gets the job done.
I love this sewing machine, it's easy to use and understand and comes with a manual that actually answers questions. I've never had a sewing machine before and this super easy to work and understand.
I wanted to make restickable printed stickers out of printer paper. I lathered the glue on, let it dry, and then tried to stick the homemade stickers on glass, cabinets doors, etc. It was barely tacky and would not hold, especially if there was any curve to the item to which I was adhering the sticker. I then put on a second coat and let them dry. They stuck better, but still had problems around curved items (pop bottles, etc.) I finally put a third coat on them and stuck them on wet. They stuck, but then I couldn't get them off. It had a reusable quality for flat surfaces after the two coats, which is why I gave it three stars, however, I finally went to printable sticker paper to make my stickers--a lot less hassle!
I ordered this because it was in gold and silver tone, it came today in silver tone only. I have 2 of each size in silver tone.
I purchased this tool for cutting circles. I found it very difficult to use. As stated in another review, it did not work well with thick cardstock paper but with thin paper. You have to apply pressure to hold it in place (my wrist was sore after using this product). I will be returning this tool for a refund.
I find myself stuck in a crappy duplex townhouse with a boorish necrophage on the other side who loves to slam his kitchen cabinets around. I bought these to stick on the bottoms of my Anchor-Hocking glass canisters to decrease the cacophony of clinking when he slam-dances into the cabinets on the other side. They work well when they stick -- as someone else described, sometimes they slip right off. I advise carefully washing the surface with soap to clean oils and applying once completely dry.
******Updated: after trying for a while, saw gray on gray arrows...and was able to use product. Great product once you can move the handle up to punch! Would be 5 stars if better instructions.Great handle, lightweight. However, the handle is SOLDERED into a "locked" position, making this no more than a paperweight. I tried moving the slider to the left, to unlock, as the arrows showed. Alas, when checking underneath, noticed a piece of metal soldered, making it impossible to unlock the handle and actually punch any papers. What good is a three hole paper punch that won't punch paper? None for me.Great amazon service and delivery, but I'll be returning this one. Sometimes, you just need a little punch!
I received this quickly and it was exactly what was advertised. These little boxes are perfect for small gifts - just add a bow!
March 2011 - I'm updating this review based on the heavy use I put it through the past year (downgraded from 4 stars). When I first bought the machine I rarely used it but when I did I completed several projects at once. This past year I started an Etsy shop and found the need for sewing everyday. I'm not talking about making leather bags or premium denim, just your average quilt-weight cottons, some linens, and occasionally heavy interfacing. The machine could not handle thick layers. And while I understand it's not meant to sew through 10+ layers on a consistent basis all I needed was for it to sew through five layers at the handle-to-bag points. The tension became insane, too tight/too loose on either top or bottom stitching and it would not go back, even after I had it "fixed" by a repair shop (for $65). The shop managed to fix the timing however so I could start to reuse it. A month after it's repair the timing broke again. I refuse to pay for another visit to the shop, another$65 and that's basically the cost of this machine!! It's true you get what you pay for. Light projects with intermittent use is the best use for this type of machine.--------------------I bought this machine as a substitute to my grandmother's heirloom Singer. I had some hesitation with a machine that was computerized because I'm very accustomed to the standard knob and dial machines. Overall this is a great piece of equipment.Advantages: Great manual, it will tell you how to do almost everything you'd like to do with the machine. Numerous accessories, several feet, bobbins, and other standard sewing pieces come courtesy of Brother. The ease of switching feet, the automatic threader (which, not to be misleading, you still have to manually wind the thread through the machine, this model comes with an arm that pulls the thread through the needle for you - hence the name). The drop-in bobbin. Goes through most fabrics readily, including double and triple folded materials (with exception of some sturdier fabrics - i.e. leather). One of the quietest motors I've ever worked with. Easy to trouble shoot.Disadvantages: You can only use the bobbin model that comes with the machine, it won't accept any other kinds. The dome light is very dim. The machine also tends to be overly sensitive to you manually poking around. When I first turned on the machine I nudged the needle, to which the LED display immediately flashed an E6 warning (that was an easy fix, I just turned it off then back on). To get all the stitch functions it take some time getting used to the four control buttons. Which, again, not to be misleading the "77" stitches are variations of 35+ standard ones. I also didn't understand I hadn't wound the bobbin thread all the way through either, it resulted in terrible tension control during my first project. You may be trouble shooting a lot until you get to used to the machine. But the majority of the time the problems are simple and once fixed you'll never have that problem again.
I lost some weight and didnt want to throw away my belts that were very expensive... I also didnt want to put a hole in my belt with just anything because the stress created at the puncher point could start ripping. So I did some research and found out about this leather hole punch tool. This works great. It looks professional. And the hole is strong.
I was searching for a good dye for nylon, the product says it is great. I tried it, did everything it asked, and no good results, poor product.
The paper is good, I can't find anything wrong with it. I using it for my college photography class, and the printer they have has a gloss optimizer on it, so that makes it glossy instead of luster, but that isn't the papers fault. When I first opened the package, I tried to tear the bag only to have someone tell me that the top is just a flap that closes again. It is pretty heavy paper. It is a good product.
Wow! Amazon is selling Lion Brand Jiffy for $9.20? It's regular price at Jo-ann's is $3.99, I believe. I just went to Joann.com, and Jiffy waslisted as $3.29 reg. price.
Nice, but nothing to write home about. Good quality, but you could probably find something better for the money.
I'm very happy with my purchase of sewable Swedish tracing paper. So far I have used it for tracing patterns. I have no doubt that it would be great to actually sew it, but I have not yet tried that. I will most certainly buy it again.
I have old pencils and being Scot, I like to save money.. In this case I only use my Prismacolored Pencils...they are the best!
These blades fit my rotary cutter (KAI RS-45) and made nice smooth cuts through the fabric. BUT, they scar my Olfa "self-healing" cutting mat. So, I would not recommend them if you plan to use them on a cutting mat. In contrast, I recently purchased replacement blades made by Olfa (45MM also fit my cutter) and no scarring.
Kind of disappointed with this, there aren't a ton of easy patterns and the ones that are in the book are pretty basic and not very creative. There are cute sweater patterns but I don't think I am there yet, so we'll see. Left wanting more.
I was given a one of a kind vase that I havent been able to display because our cat is a climber, with an established path of destruction in his wake.The vase I wanted to secure has a wide base and isnt very tall, so I thought the putty might work well to give it some stability if it happened to get brushed with an errant tail. Unfortunately, this was not to be.I followed the directions and still had a hard time even manipulating the shape of the putty, almost as though it had been sitting on a shelf for too long and had gone stale (if that makes any sense). I couldnt get it to stick to the vase or the surface underneath it, at all. It was a complete waste for me, very disappointing.
Way too expensive for what the product is - found at half the price at other locations. Feel cheated!
I like this darning foot, although the one I got was NOT the one in the picture. I'm not too worried about it though because it works just fine. I don't know that it is actually made by singer or not, but it works, so I'm happy. I don't have anything negative to say about the one I received, except (again) it is not the one in the picture.
Ok, this wasn't the size that I wanted. However, I called about sending back and spoke to Eric. He was super helpful and friendly. I sent it back and received an email stating my account had been refunded. They were great to work with!
The bag contained a sampling of quilling papers (very short, no room for mistakes or practice) and a few poorly photocopied, inane instructions. There are no copyrights on the instructions, so who knows where they came from? You can buy more quilling paper for the money and find better instructions for free on the Internet. I will be more wary of these kinds of "kits" in the future.
I had to do an arts and crafts project for a camp I was part of the medical staff team. We used stencils, after doing the project I thought it would be a great way to do very personal gifts for friends and family.
This table jumps when I sew a fast stitch on my sewing machine while it is on this table. So much so that when I sew on the machine on the table, my scissors and pins will bounce right off the table onto the floor. I sew a lot and needed a table for my new machine. It was actually so difficult to see what I was sewing when the table was jumping that I finally switched it with my serger machine that I don't use much and juts use it as a flat surface table as the opening is not big enough for the serger.Also, when I had my straight stitch machine on the table and dropped it down to sew level with the table my knees would hit the dropped part when I sat up to the table to sew. It is difficult to change from a dropped position to a level position fast. You have to completely remove the machines cords and I also removed the machine to make sure it didn't fall.I would not recommend this to anyone wanting to use it for a sewing machine.
This was a monster of a machine. It was difficult to thread and would bunch thread coming up from the bobbin. I'm pretty mechanically inclined and just could not solve the problem.I eventually replaced with a low end Brother machine and have been happily sewing ever since.
If you don't sew too much it's a good little machine, but oh so frustrating to change the bobbin and every time you use the thread cutter the presser foot falls off. If I looked closer on this machine I would never have bought it, I would have made sure the bobbin loads from the top. If you want to put this machine in a sewing table, you have to crawl under the table to change bobbin. To thread a new bobbin you have to rethread...........summary. good for once in a while sewing and mending,priced good,but not user friendly.
I love Prismacolor pencils and have used them in the past. My disappointment lies in the fact that the tin they came in was dented and scratched. The damage didn't happen during shipping. . .it was apparent that the damaged product was placed in the box before shipping. Shame on Amazon for shipping damaged goods.
Fast and reliable, works like a charm for both 2 and 3 hole punches. I find I can do up to 20 pages at at time. I love it!
The price was right and the quality of the product is sturdy, easy to put together. There could be a place for the paper to be attached to the easel other than the magnets, they are not very strong and a place for the paper to be attached when not using. Also there could be some protective pads for the bottom of the easel so as not to mar the table surface.Ordering from Amazon.com was GREAT and I will definately use them again. Thanx for a great experience!
My children are in their 20 and over the years I have collected quite a few 10 X 13 photos of them. The current photo is always on display but the others were just being stored away since I had no way to display them safely. These portfolios were the answer. They hold all their special photos with room to spare for future photos. They nicely hold the 10 X 13 photos as well as the few 11 X 14 photos that I have. The portfolios themselves are compact and lightweight so they will be easy for me to tuck away but nice enough to pull out whenever I want to browse through them. I ordered one portfolio for each of my two children so that when the time is right I can pass down their photos to each of them. Since there are spare pages in each portfolio I may even rearrange them and add in some of their artwork and other photos that I have saved over the years. The price on these portfolios is very reasonable and I find the quality to be very good. My order was shipped very quickly and I received the order in less than a week.
This is our first machine in quite some time and it all started out great. We love the features and ease of use is a big plus.That being said, we now have a problem with the machine drawing fabric through at a diagonal slant. Somehow, the stitches come out straight but we have to work at a diagonal which will be very difficult for larger projects or tight corners. The fabric also will 'bend' and curve itself from the force of a diagonal pull and straight stitches.If it weren't for that problem, we would probably go for a 5-star review as the features are nice and the machine is easy to maneuver. At $160 online, this machine is a good buy...now to fix it!
Easy to use, came quickly in the mail. I put my name on my luggage so I'll never loose it.
This yarn is soft but that is the best I can say about it. I crocheted a baby blanket with it and thought I would never get through the project. There were long sections of the yarn where the splitting and bunching up of fibers was so bad I felt like I was trying to manipulate clouds of cobwebs. I had to press on because there was no way of determining by sight or touch where the bad areas began and ended. If I could have known I would have cut the bad sections out. I had to re-do stitches two, three, even four or five times in spite of proceeding VERY slowly and with extreme care . On another web site there were many negative reviews of this yarn but there were good ones too and the few reviews on Amazon were favorable so I decided to go ahead and order. Big mistake. The tediousness and frustration of working with this yarn displaced the enjoyment of creating the blanket and this was a blanket for my first grandson so you gotta' figure things had to be pretty bad to crush the pleasure of making this blanket. Maybe the yarn works well for knitting. I threw the left over yarn in the trash and that's saying something considering what a penny pincher I am. I hope if I am some day compelled to make another baby item that there are other easier to work with soft yarns available
I purchased the medium block punch, thinking I would have a 1" x 1" square.After receiving the punch, however, I find it is smaller. On the back of the package it says it is "1 cm/.625 inches" . First, I don't think 1 cm equals .625 inches. Second, there is nothing in the descriptions (here or elsewhere that I could find) saying it is 1" across DIAGONALLY. So if anyone is needing a 1" x 1" square, this is not it.Otherwise, the quality of these punches are fair. Not excellent, but they are handy and easy to use.
I gave this unit 2 stars because it is potentially great for children to knit items they might not have patience or skill for otherwise. However, the machine is contructed of close to 90% plastic and just not strong enough for an excited little girl trying to spin the crank at as good pace. My daughter had a tough time figuring the machine out, and once we finally got it to go, with standard weight yarn (not the cheap stuff they supply, but not heavy either) she got half way through the project and the crank broke off! My daughter is no brute, in fact, she is quite delicate and scrawny, so this really surprised me!Customer support was helpful. It was tough to finally find a phone number for this company, but when I called, the lady I spoke with was quite helpful. She told me to cut out the UPC code and send it in with a letter describing the issue, and they would send out a new crank right away. Well, almost two months later I finally received a box, but inside was just that top handle that is used for support - NO CRANK!So, I sent off another note telling them they sent the wrong part. This time they sent me a brand new machine. However, it was in a hundred little pieces, had completely fallen apart in shipping. Their response was swift - a notice giving me credit to trade for any of their other products except for this one. I'm not sure if they were tired of dealing with this inferior product or dealing with me. Suffice it to say, we never cashed in the note for credit on another item. I just don't trust the quality.Unfortunately, I'd have to advise anyone looking at this as a nice gift to just pass it by.
At first I had problems learing how to use the auto stop but once I played with it for a few hours, I was able to master the operation of the machine. As far as the stitch quality I love it, also it is comprable to the electronic machine I purchased 6 months ago. So there!... I love the beautiful decorative stitches, especially the one with the cross and the heart well all of them! The instruction manual it is very self explanatory and helpful on the use of the machine and presser feet. I love it and that's that, I have owned the machine and already have made a semiformal outfit for Easter and it lived up to my expectation and then some. By the way I have been sewing since 1970, and am not a new seamstress.
It does what it says. It is not a full designer software just a card reader-writer for Brother embroidery cards and this is exactly what I wanted.Very happy with it.
If you are punching items "stand alone" these are probably okay, although the spread on the handles is almost too wide for my hand to grasp comfortably. However, for me as a card maker, they are pretty much a loss because the depth is about 1/8" which is no good at all for positioning. I'll figure out a way to make my circle dies from Spellbinders work. If you are looking at being able to position a circle cut on the interior of a page, don't get this.
only enough scent for two small candles.......will order larger size next time so I can make more than two candles.
As my title suggests, this thing is a hunk of junk. After about five minutes of use, the shuttle hook became misaligned and the whole things stopped working. Unfortunately, it appears that there is no replacement for a real machine.
We got these for our 18 month old son in Christmas of 2009. They were great. Smaller than you might expect, but they had bright colors - worked when wet - even if dunked and were long lasting - we still have 4 of the 6 colors - although they are running out. They also cleaned so easily!So we decided it would be a great Christmas present this year (Xmas 2010). However the new set is horrible! We just opened it to start using and they clearly changed the crayons. They are slighly longer within the holders (probably due to complaints about how short they actual crayon part was) and the colors are slighly different. But those are not the issues. The issues are that the crayons do not draw on any bit of water or even damp, but dried off with a towel surface. If you do draw on a dry surface the crayons are used up super fast. What use is a longer length if they get used up 5-6 times as fast?The "scrubber duckie" as my son calls it, is not as good either. The back used to be textured and helped "scrub" off the crayons - although it wiped off with a cloth. But it was flexible so you could wring out the duck to dry. The new duck has a stiff back that does not help at all wiping away anything and also cannot be wrung dry.My son keeps asking for the "old crayons" even though we no longer have his favorite colors. He would rather have something tha can draw in the bath than his favorite colors.A HUGE dissapointment that they changed a wonderful product.
These squeeze punches are the easiest to use. I won't buy another kind from now on. So much easier on your hands.
My bad. I was thinking this was comparable to Crayola's tempera paint, which IS washable. The paint is great, nice colors, but we got a little on clothing and can't get it out completely. I'd still recommend this paint, just be sure your little one wears a smock.
Great product for the price. Only down was the shipping... Arrived with the table top chipped along the bottom edge where the pencil catcher goes.Also some of the tubes were bent at the opening so badly that you couldn't fit the other tube that went into it in it. But luckily i have access to a machine shop so i could resize the holes. The little boxes on the side were a little difficult to snap together and the table top being slightly warped from heat, its been realy nice.All in all its realy nice for drawing, reading, and whatever have u.P.S. Only thign it realy needs is a swing lamp which I am getting seprately.
I purchased this for my daughter who is 3yrs old. I didn't know how well she was going to like it but it turns out that she loves it. I would recommend purchasing the seperate ink pad though because she loves to change all the different colors. And the best part of all of it is the ink is washable!! It is also fun to see her stamp and then to color in the stamp with the pencils that were included. I would definatley recommend this product.
I bought these beads for my 4+ year old daughters little bitty bicycle, they're very nice. They have a slit on one side which you force the spoke through, and these beads are solid enough that they aren't about to fall back off, very nice feature. Also they are just enough larger then the spokes to slide up an down making the much needed "noise" from the wheels kids love. Only thing I dislike is that the colors are kind of muted, they would be so much nicer if they were like bright neon or something, but the blue and purple colors are really dull. Of course they might have had another set with brighter colors I missed, but other that this the set is wonderful.
I bought this for my 2 year old who loves to draw on her easel. I wanted to get a variety of colors, and test out the paint before buying the large containers available. The paint is great...washes right off. I have no fear that it would stain something. HOWEVER, this is not a value. I will be buying the large individual crayola paints for her going forward, like this oneCrayola Artista II Washable Tempera Paint 16oz Blue
It's a good medium for the price. The only real problem I have is the medium seals the container shut if you don't use it for a few days it is really hard to get open.
I gave this to my husband as a gift, and he loved it! It's very heavy and nice quality. However, we can't seem to get the knack of embossing with just the right amount of pressure: the impression is either too light or goes all the way through the paper.
This document tube is of inferior quality compared with some other products on the market. While the adjustable length feature is nice, the tube doesn't stay locked at the desired size and often the two halves completely separate. Tape is required at the joint to hold the two pieces together.
I followed all of the instructions and, at first, could not get this machine to work in an acceptable manner. Frequently, the upper stitch would not connect with the lower (bobin) stitch. I tried various tension settings and checked all of the threading many times.Then, I purchased a better thread for sewing machines and tried adjusting the tension settings again. I was finally able to get the product to sew correctly.I would still have to say, this product is not for the faint of heart. But, it will work if you are tenacious!
I have purchased many paint by numbers from Paintworks previously. I love doing them, my only complaint is on some pictures, the darker colors are watered down so it requires a second coat.
OMG why can't I just sew???? I worked for Levi years ago and know how to sew. I will say I am very disappointed with this machine. I have had it apart at least 3 times every time I sit down to sew. It is VERY easy to misthread the very first step which throws everything off from the beginning. If you take that cover off to clean out broken threads you MUST put it back on before rethreading and sewing, otherwise the thread is behind where it is not suppose to be. I had to stop and clean out broken threads from the very first time I used it. I may be sending this machine back.!!!!!!
My sister bought me this sewing machine a yr. ago, it lasted a little over a yr. Mind you, I do not sew, it was used merely for mending and light sewing. It's not a good investment, save your money and buy not good brand. Seriously, this is NOT a good machine.
This is a nice, thick, wide tape. However, it is not particularly sticky, and doesn't seem very different from thick packing tape. Note that 3 inch and 4 inch wide versions are available. Especially at 4 inches, that's much wider than any packing tape, and therefore useful for repairing bindings on books, magazines, and other published items.Here's a more meaningful explanation from another site: 3M 845 Book Tape is a tough crystal-clear transparent tape with a long-aging, synthetic adhesive that conforms readily to book contours and flexes with cover movements. Excellent for repairing, reinforcing, protecting and covering bound edges and surfaces. Use on books, magazines, pamphlets, record album jackets and more. The transparent polypropylene backing has excellent clarity which doesn't hide title information or printing and saves time and money by eliminating relabeling. It is tough, flexible, resists abrasion and cracking, and is conformable which reduces rebinding or replacement costs. Its synthetic adhesive is long aging and will not discolor or dry out so it won't deteriorate with time causing possible subsequent repair.
I have bought this kit to do a papermaking project with my son. Unfortunately, we could not watch the video as we do not have a VCR, only a DVD player.The papermaking screen is nice, actually you can use either the screen or the window mesh to lift out paper sheets. If you want to create watermarks, you have to sew pattern onto the window screen , as the papermaking screen is too fine for that (sewing would damage it). To drain water from newly made paper sheets we used pieces of denim rather than the plastic sheets supplied in the kit. For making pulp, we used reed fragmides stems boiled for 50 minutes in 3M NaOH solution.Basically, we made nice paper in the end but I would have preferred a screen already stretched on the frame, rather than kept flat by the plastic grid support as it is here.
This pair of scissors is mediocre at best. I can see it's value for those with arthritic hands, with the easy to grasp, spring loaded handles.The pair I had was very poorly put together. The spring which keeps the scissors open kept dislodging and flying across the room. The nut and bolt holding the blades together would also come undone intermittently. I fixed the problem by melting the plastic around the spring, permanently fixing it into place and by tightenign the bolts.My advice is to spend a little more money and get a pair of Henckels scissors, which are much sturdier. The blades also can be separated for easy cleaning (there are no nuts and bolts to become loose either).
Very nice color, good quality cnstruction paper. I am giving it three stars, because I was misled by the posting and the image that I was buying 12x18 size paper.
My twin girls, 3, loved these stamps but they had a hard time getting enough ink on the stamps. It was almost as if the ink pad had dried out or something, but the package came completely sealed. I will buy other ink pads, and I am sure the girls will continue to use the stamps.
I bought these based on some online reviews. I currently use 140lb Arches paper and W & N Artists' Sable Brushes. I found these very water and have poor pigment. I would not recommend it.
The 1/16" hole punch was a good size for punching holes in fabric in order to crochet an edging. The only fault that I have is the pricing. Martha Stewart makes a 1/16" hole punch, sold at WalMart for much less money and without the extra cost of shipping.So sorry Fiskars
I like the form factor, I like how eazy the blade comes is unprotected, protected. But I'm not sure it really does that great of a job, I bought it for the wife to cut down boxes (we buy way too much through Amazon),and she really doesn't like it.It is probably a great hobby blade, scrapbooking etc, but for heavier around the house tasks, eh..
It is a decent program(PC Stitch) and it loaded fine but when I went to use it, it would not work with my version of Windows Vista. It was and older program and I could not find anything on it on the web but again I didn't look that hard.The program is good i'm sure for it's day but I found a newer version and it works really well. I did not try to make it compatible in my current OS.
I bought the Brother 25-Stitch Free-Arm Sewing Machine - XL-2600i and needed the carrying case as it didn't come with one. The case will work but it does not fit snug, it moves around a little bit when carrying it. My old Singer machine had a case that came with it so it fit snug, so compared to that it is not perfect but it works fine.
Bought this for my daughter,a scrapbooker, for Christmas. She is the talk of her show. All her counterparts want to know where she got it from. Great value for the price. Looks even better than the photo.
this could be a great cartridge if it had the numbers 9 & 0....but they don't! how could they do that? And I needed it the first time I used it. How sad.
I should give this no stars, but mine didn't have as many problems as other people have said they have had. It can't take much, it doesn't do the job well, and the bobbins that they give you can't be re-wound with a different thread once you have used up what they gave you! I'm with the others: take your needle, batteries, and bobbin and throw the rest away! You will spend more time undoing the poor job of this machine than if you were to try to do the project by hand!
This book is wonderful. It answers a great deal of question about sergering and is very detailed. The information it gives can be used with any machine. I have recommended this book to others.
I have owned the machine for over a year now. I am sure than anyone who gave this machine more than 1 star didn't own it long enough to figure out how sucky it really is. The first thing is that the manual isn't very good. I think they were afraid of text because descriptions are short and lacking detail. The second complaint I have is a common one for this machine: it jams up all the time! I spend more time screwing with the tension and re-threading than sewing. It is so frustrating! I had to take it to a professional to fix it once and it is broken again. It isn't worth it for me to keep fixing this headache of a machine! Trust me on this one, spend some extra money and get a better machine.
Do not buy this! Needle is terrible difficult to thread, can't get it to stitch after working with it for an hour. Such a disappointment for my daughter. Follow the old adage, you get what you pay for. Singer should be embarrassed to have their name on this.
Didn't fit my singer. I also didn't realize that I could return it and I think I missed the return window.
This cutter fit the bill. We needed to perforate meal tickets and couldn't find a cutter to perforate anywhere. Fortunately, Amazon had the Fiskars and it worked like a charm.
Great sewing machine...I'm enjoying it very much and am tickled I got such a great bargain.
I bought this stencil set for two girls ages five and three and had the opportunity to play with them once they received the gift. They were fascinated with them but needed some encouragement and direction how to use them. It comes in a nice plastic case with a handle and is easily stored and portable to take with on trips. It is also organized with primary colors and also with seasons/holidays of the year.
I received this item missing 2 of the brushes, one broken, a slightly crushed case, and the product appear to have been used. The shipping packaging was fine. I began the process of return for replacement, which was not offered, only a refund. Problem is the refund amount is only two thirds of the purchase price after shipping, even less with UPS pickup. I'm keeping the item as it was intended for a gift, but I will have to try finding replacement brushes at the craft store. So much for internet convenience. If it was complete, it would be a nice little gift for a young person new to sumi e.
I asked for a jewelry cleaner for christmas and recieved this one as a gift. It is very loud when operating and the lid vibrates because it does not shut tight. I have to put a heavy book on top of it to keep the noise down. Also it only comes with four cleaning soultion packets and suggests that you change the solution at each use. The solution is somewhat hard to find.I only gave this two stars because it DOES get my rings sparkling, but with the loud operation and hard to find solution I would not reccomend it.
The idea of the organization of sewing needs are good, but the products within are not in the tradition of Singer products..I was especially disappointed with the scissors...they are very cheaply made and bend easily when you use them...not how I would expect a pair of scissors to be...the plastic on the handles are very cheaply made...the pin cushion is a mini- size of the larger one that I have...was expecting it to be full size...bobbin holders are cheap plastic. the case however is nice.
We bought this for our 11 year old daughter. She is very crafty and imaginative. However, this loom was a nightmare. She tried it twice, and was on the verge of tears with frustration. I think it will end up at Goodwill!
A must have if your a anime artist or any kind of artist for that matter... these pens work great and love how they come in an arrange of sizes.
I shopped around, did get it cheaper here. still payed to much for it. doesn't work with my machine. not easy to use.
The Epson system is very simple to use and produces sharp 4 X 6 prints with fine color reproduction.Sometimes you get lines across the printor even no picture at all.This is due to a dirty surface.It is easy to clean although uses some ink.Each ink refill lasts a long time.I bought mine for $99 and regard as very good value for money
Very nice machine and easy to use. Will do just great for my crafts and quilts as well as all other sewing I may need to do. I am a beginning quilter. Easy to understand instructions for someone familiar with a sewing machine. I have been sewing some for years but may be more difficult for a beginning sewer to understand. I really love this nice light machine.
I was looking for a replacement sewing machine. I'm a beginner and didn't want to spend too much money until I knew how much I would use it. This was a perfect replacement machine for me!
Bought the identical zipper tab for a winter jacket at a local fabric store. Wish they were twice as big, but I haven't been able to found any other replacement that works other than a large paper clip (which keeps working its way off). This replacement zipper tab also worked its way off the tiny ring that goes through the original zipper's (large paper clip sized) hole. Crimping the ring may fix that.
The Chiller is great and was delivered on time and met the description from the add. Would like to have had the oils and manufacturing grease removed. I knew I would have to sterlize it, but the manufacturer knows it is going to be used in beer making and just provides directions for removing the oils. Should be done before shipping.
While this tape is a tiny bit thicker than the standard Scotch packaging tape, I can't see that it is really worth the higher price. As with all new products, I like to try them out exactly how the directions say before doing things my way, and the directions for repairing a paperback book are pretty much useless. The tape rips easily, so trying to make precision cuts with a normal pair of scissors was basically impossible for me to do without the tape simply ripping the whole way across. What "tabs" did manage to not tear off were of no use repairing the book in question, so I quickly abandoned the suggested way and did my own thing. I am thoroughly not impressed with the product and am very disappointed in its quality, especially considering the price.
I'm sure this product would be nice, as it was everything I was looking for. However, this company absolutely does not ship APO. It is not expensive nor are they shipping to a foreign country. APOs count as U.S. addresses. They seriously need to rethink this policy.
I really do like this yarn and have been using it for many many years. I will buy more of it some day but would prefer to find it a bit cheaper if possible and in a variety of colors. But thank you for the response in getting it sent out right away as I was in the middle of a project and needed the extra yarn to complete.
Not really much fun for a 4 year old. The end product is cute but not a lot of creativity involved
I bought this thinking I could use it for my design work, presentations, etc. I'm lucky if I get a perfect corner 1 out of 4 tries. There's almost always a rough spot or something that is unrepairable unless you recut it. It cuts fine, just tough to get it aligned perfectly in the 90 so you don't end up with odd little edges. Maybe had it been larger so you could really wedge the corner up in there, it would be more accurate. I'll keep messing with it, but until now, not a fan...
I bought it to punch holes in my belts. It gets the job done. a really handy tool to keep
I've had my Sizzix for years...use it constantly for scrapbooking and school projects with the kids. I love it!
I'm an art teacher...I've done plenty of casting, but the instructions for this need to be rewritten. They state leave 1.5 inches at the top after filling with water....not enough space for the powder...and if you pouring then mixing... then the product has different consistencies. [...].
These are decent scissors that do a good job. A big draw is that they have a lifetime warranty.Fortunately, I didn't have the problem of the scissors falling apart as other US reviewers have noted. They work very well and are just what they are - a good pair of scissors. They are excellent sewing scissors and do a good job of cutting cloth.
Product is way too loud. Can't keep it in the house, we had to put in the shop. I would not recommend becouse of the noise levels.
I returned it because I found one much cheaper at Walmart. Downside was paying return postage which still resulted in a savings from the original purchase price.
I ordered this blindly thinking the top rated/selling paper would be your standard 8.5x11 size... WRONG. The paper is longer than 11&#34; meaning I get to trim each thing I print. I truly haven't seen a paper this size before and will not be purchasing this again.
What can I say? the are pens that are metalic and the colors are very pretty. four more mords and one more.
Everyone needs a serger. I don't have a lot of knowledge and this machine was perfect. I was able to thread it with just a little help from the DVD. It works like a dream. My mother in law owns a very expensive machine that she paid well over $1000 for, and I feel my machine that I spent around $200 for works just as well. I like it better too. This is a great machine especially if you are new to sewing and just want something to help you finish edges. I use mine for almost everything. I serge the edges of fabric before I wash it, I serge the edges of fabric before I sew them, I just love to serge.
These are such good colored pencils, beautiful saturated colors, soft leads, adecuate case, good color selection. But the pictures don't match exactly what I received. It's supposed to be included 2 art crayons, I think pastels, and a metal sharpener. They didn't come. That's the only reason why I choose 3 instead of 5 stars, because you buy something and expect to receive THAT item. The case is the same without the purple sticker, pencils seem to be the same as the pictures just without the bonuses. And the mail packaging was not the ideal for such a fragile product.3 MONTHS AFTER: What I have thought about the bad packaging affects the quality of this item now. Definitely! Some of the pencils have to be sharpened too often because the leads are broken inside. That's only due to the completely inadecuate packaging for this kind of product. People who know about art supplies would recognize that pencils should be packed as very fragile items, otherwise, they won't last long. It's not noticeable, but you as a customer receive pencil with broken leads, and that's what happened to me. Now I chose only two stars.
Good kit, nice paper, but the instructions aren't as detailed or step-by-step as I was hoping for. Had to go on look to look up better directions.
Sturdy cone and mesh, can be washed and re-used. Fine mesh makes for slow straining with latex paint - just what I needed prior to using for spray gun.
The seller shipped me a very OLD container. It was crumbly and didn't even attach. It ruined a project day, and I had to go to the store and buy some. Worthless. Here's a picture taken AFTER I used the iron on it. Peels right off.(...)
I read all the positive reviews about this product removing the protective coating from plastic and polycarobonate lenses and thought I would give it a try. I tried it on two different pairs of glasses (both plastic lenses), and it didn't work on either. It made the glasses worst by creating scratches since the material is highly abrasive. I tried 3 or 4 times on each pair of glasses and left the Armour-Etch on for anywhere between 5-20 minutes, and it didn't dissolve the coating at all! I have a feeling people providing positive reviews work for Armour-Etch!! I can't think of any other explanation as it didn't work on two different glasses bought at different places and in different years (one pair was 3 years old and the other pair about a year old).
This is great stuff to decorate your table with for parties, kids can play and write or draw on it... Loved it and it does well for adult parties too instead of table cloths...
After ordering this I found one much cheaper at Walmart so I returned it. I will say the return process was simple, downside was having to pay return postage, which was still cheaper than keeping it
100 pictures, I think not!I printed maybe 15 pictures before it told me your print pack is low and needs replacing!Horrible product and would not recommend.
The fit and precision of the tools are excellent. Tips match perfectly and are strong and resistant to bending. I highly recommend these for working with small hobby projects.
The frame comes with no lateral cross bracing, so it can lean heavily side-to-side. In fact, it will lean so much that the drawers will fall off of one of the side rails and then they all become tilted and jammed. It also makes it very difficult to roll around. A simple fix is to cut a piece of thin (1/8 inch to 1/4 is fine) plywood or similar material to fit the back of the frame. Drill holes through the wood and 4 of the back flanges that stop the shelves from going out the back. Attach the wood to the flanges with 4 nuts and bolts. Make sure to straighten the frame BEFORE drilling the holes! Once the four corners are attached, it will give the frame the rigidity it so desperately needs. Without it, I would not recommend buying this unit.
I ordered this foot to use to make quilts. It is ok but I found one I like better. Here is a link to it http://www.amazon.com/Brother-1-4-Inch-Quilting-Foot/dp/B001H61A6Y/ref=cm_cr-mr-title
I bought this machine through Amazon.com and from now on I will not buy their appliances. To return an item to Amazon costs the price of shipping and, believe me, that is adding insult to injury. Amazon should be ashamed to sell it.I am an able sewer, 4 decades at it, and this machine is a waste of time and space. It comes with a book detailing threading techniques and stiches. As you work through the list of stiches you will be struck again and again by how poorly designed and constructed the machine is. uccessful stiching is actually and accident. When you get to the buttonhole stitch you will start saving for that new Janome....The worst aspect is the tension and threading route. The tension on this machine is hard to figure until you realize that the tension spring is INSIDE the housing and you cannot reach it, BUT the thread hops out of it's loop in there as you sew; pick up speed as you sew and you will hear the sound of the lower thread balling up and jamming the machine. Stop, clear it off, rethread and go on, sewing more slowly and hoping. About 50% of your seams will be sewn correctly. The other half will require rethreading.Since purchasing this machine I have met two women who bought it and cannot use it for the same reason: the threading is impossible, a shoddily designed machine. Stop, rethread and go on. Thread leaves spring. Stop, rethread ----- you get the idea.Save your money. This is too cheap to use. Life is too short. I will finish my project and throw this out
This paper is good for black and white prints if you put it behind glass. The matte paper prevents any bronzing.
This might be okay if you're punching thin paper, one sheet at a time, but when I tried heavier paper the plastc - yes, plastic! - handle snapped right off. Maybe mine had a defect, or a weak section, but without a metal core the plastic will eventually weaken and break. Not at all worth the money, I will never buy one like this again.
This was a nice price item, but the nibs are not true. The Fine is not fine, it is medium, and the medium is only good for the calligraphy piece. The broad is for posters, not regular paper! Huge lines.
I learned to rely on reviews only after-the-fact!! This machine is awful!! I bought mine about 2 yrs ago, and it worked ok for about the first year sewing very simple things (pillow cases & such). But after that, it went downhill like it was on a luge! I made the gigantic mistake of not doing enough research before I bought it. It loses it's tension very, very easily. I took it in to be repaired, which cost almost as much as the machine itself. It then worked great - as long as I only used straight stitches. Anything other than a straight stitch on a lightweight fabric will mess the tension up severely!My biggest suggestion for this particular machine, is DON'T BUY IT!! It's just not worth all the trouble!
My wife bought one of the CE-100s and after she couldn't get it running she turned it over to me, her resident tech-head with a PhD in computer science, to get the thing running. In the end it never ran at all.My conclusion is that a pack of wolves could write better software and manuals. First you will find that the manual and install card give exactly opposite instructions on the order in which to plug in the USB and install the software (a critical detail for testy installs). After multiple installs using multiple clean machines I determined the correct order and was able to get the USB recognized. I visited a half-dozen forums and used every trick out there.Ultimately it was all for nothing. The machine never did anything but light up and blink red all over - indicating error. The manual has a helpful list of error codes and tells you what to do based on the error code displayed.Big problem: there is no error display! You will never know what error the machine thinks it has!I tried methodically restarting, refreshing, and then undergoing the corrective actions for every possible error on the list - all to absolutely no effect. Ultimately I believe the problem is probably an internal mechanical one. I think the mix of "1" ratings with normal ratings is the luck of the draw whether you get a working machine or not, and the odds look to be below 50%.
Oxalic acid is unique in that it will remove a certain type of stain formed when iron and moisture come into contact with tannic acid in the wood. Oxalic acid will remove this discoloration without affecting the natural color of the wood.
It is not a bad product and the price was good. Having said that, the clips that adjust to hold item do not lock very securely & can slip. Measurement numbers or notches would help guarantee both adjustable legs the same height.
This set is not too bad but the blades are not the same as shown. Its a pretty cheep set but nice for the price, good for beginers.
I found the material to be thin and not satisfactory. I ended up purchasing fleece in a fabric store and making my own quilt.
I had a hard time choosing a glue gun. I choose this one for it's 2 temp setting, nice long cord and the ability to go cordless. Does take some time to heat but once it do the glue dispensed easily and not too messy! Before it will work, you do need to insert glue sticks the first time!
it doesn't hold up no lasting value. repair to visible not really a quick fix. Needs to be updated to modern times
Had to return this item as it is not compatible with my Mac! When will Brother get with it that Mac people would like to use their products too. I am happy with the Brother SE 350 so far, but haven't tried the embroidery part.
I purchased this strictly for its features of push button sewing, needle up/down, and the accompanying enlarged sewing area using the table that comes with the machine. The price was excellent. I did experience a catch 22 with the bobbin thread. It will repeatedly catch up under the sewn fabric resulting in a ball of thread. However, I have been able to overcome this by positioning the sewing threads neatly to the side while using just slight pressure over them until a couple of stitches have been sewn. The grey plastic plate around the bobbin area seams to 'float' and not be firmly attached but it has remained in position and causes no issues. I was forced to unscrew the plate over the feed dogs to remove the first thread jam caused by bobbin thread but that has not been necessary since then. The amount of light shown on the sewing area is sufficient and the computerized stitch choices are very easy to adjust. I also like the ability to adjust needle placement to ensure the 1/4" seam I use for quilting. I will add that the tension needed to be adjusted to 7 ensure good stitches. I paid such a fantastic price for this machine that I cannot complain about it's quality. Value is there. This is my 2nd Brother as I also own their embroidery/sewing machine.
The scrapbook itself was very pretty and colorful. However, all 20 of the inside pages were torn. When I asked about getting replacements I was told they had none in stock and did not plan to order any. So, if anything you order from this company isn't isn't perfect, don't expect them to make it right! Also, the spine of the scrapbook itself was a little off. Using a lot of muscle and some judicious hole punching I manged to fit 6 new pages into it--enough to give to my friend for her baby but not at all what I'd expected. I am a big fan of pepper pot products but this time I felt I got a "facotry sceond". So buyer beware!
This kit is for 28 count Evenweave fabric not 14 count as stated. I find it very challenging stitching on 28 count. I tried stitching on 14 count but became frustrated with all of the 1/2 stitches this pattern calls for, and have set it aside for now. I do like the design and the colors. The description really needs to be updated.
Beginning Sumi kits should include a pictoral description of the items in the kit and of how to make the ink from the soot sticks. We wanted to begin penning Japanese characters but were not sure how to begin. Once we found a U-tube video we were home free, but Christmas morning it was kinda depressing not to be able to just sit down and play.
I needed a dozen cheap, portable easels for a presentation I was doing across the country. This fit the bill perfectly.Caveat: These are rated to hold only five pounds. I was using them for 20x30 posters on foam core, which weighs practically nothing, so they worked perfectly. If you're displaying anything heavy, you need a heavier-duty easel.
Great serger, it does everything you need! Highly recommended
This is not a very good product and I would not suggest it to anyone. I had to file and sharpen edges myself and it still wasn't a very good product. Save your money and buy a better, quality product.
I have been sewing since I was a little girl - probably 10 or so and I am now 60!!! This machine reminded me of my first machine as a child......it stitches a nice stitch and is easy to thread and wind the bobbin. It does have some problems with the tension and they can be fixed..........I ordered this to make a lap quilt for my father for his 86th birthday - it worked amazingly well for a $35 sewing machine - it is a mending machine it says and did a nice job on a small project.....the instructional DVD was not needed by me and still was very informative and would be to someone who has never used a sewing machine......have already told many about the mighty little Sew Pro 402!!
I previously bought another gun fromt the big box store online "W". I had to return(it didn't work and the glue clogged before I could use it) the gun after waiting 10 days for ship-to-store service. The Stanley was easy to load and worked the first time out of the package. I thought it was going to take a lot of pushing of the glue sticks but the trigger fed easily and the gun worked well. It does drip some but the mat was included. They must know this so that's why they include one. I hope one day they will make an inexpensive gun that doesn't drip but until then I will continue to use this one.
The quality is fine, though it's hard to tighten the screws enough. I just find it too bulky and it's sitting in the corner now. It wasn't right for my type of art. I do India ink drawings on paper, so it doesn't act like a drawing board. I was hoping it could lay almost flat, but any pressure pushed it all the way down. I don't want to bash it, because it may be great for someone else, but not for me.
Knitting with these needles is comfortable. The yarn tends not to slide as easily as with aluminum or plastic needles. I have knitted several pairs of mittens so far and the needles are curling a bit. This is not a serious problem in as far as they will not roll off the table if you lay them aside for a moment.
They are huge but they work great. I had no problems with losing stitches. Since they are plastic it makes it easy to work with them bc they are so lightweight despite their size. My only complaint is the color, it's ugly like a very light grey.
I just received the plate stand and it is not symmetric--one side is longer, so it does not stay up straight.It looked as I was expecting, and was a good price, but the quality is not there. I could not count on this rickety plate stand to hold anything of value as I am sure it will tip complete over once there is weight on it.I hope I can get a refund but I am not pleased with the quality of this product.
but overall met my expectations. Once these corners are on the page they are not budging. I purchased to use for scrapbooking larger items and brochures, which the standard small photo corners really can't hold in place. I had previously used a Scotch product that is apparently no longer available in the US, but can be found in Canada and the UK at a premium price. This Lineco product fit the bill.
Don't get me wrong, I love Amazon and do most of my shopping here.This paper is amazing and I use hundreds of pieces a month for my art store and I have ordered this paper many times from Amazon.HOWEVER, The last 4 times I've ordered, it has come with severely bent edges. I've complained, sent it back ect ect...and still, It comes ruined.Don't waste your time buying this product from Amazon. It's a bit cheaper on Epson's site anyways.
I looked at a lot of books by Bliss before I settled on this one - it has some really nice projects. I wasn't necessarily a beginning knitter when I picked this up, so some of the projects weren't attractive for me. But I have done the boat-necked sweater, the cashmere booties, and the umbilical cord hat (several times, to the delight of friends). I'm about to start on the garter-stitch cardigan. It would be nice, though, to have diagrams showing how the pieces should turn out/be blocked. I've used different yarns with a lot of success - don't think you have to stick with her yarn. I'd recommend this book. The simplicity and elegance of the projects make them classics, and you could easily add your own touch to any of the items in the book.
I own several Fiskars products and never had an issue, so I bought these Fiskars for my 4 year old daughter after she misplaced a pair of Melissa and Doug scissors. My daughter has been using scissors for over 2 years now and never had an issue, but has had nothing but problems with these. My daughter found it awkward to find a proper finger placement and then couldn't hold a consistent amount of pressure to successfully complete her assignment. Will be scrapping these pre-school scissors and buying another pair of Melissa and Doug.
My husband and I purchased these for a rehabilitation institution for the teen residents. One might think, "What a lame thing to do" but on the contrary, some of the kids in there are artists who fell into the wrong crowd, others used them to lessen their bordom. These were very well worth the cost and each crayon arrived unbroken and in perfect condition!!!
This is not Dual Duty thread- it is 100% Polyester All Purpose Thread and it contains no cotton as advertised.
If your're a few dollars away from the free shipping deal with another item, just tack a few of these on, its well worth it.
I received this case as a Christmas gift and was surprised to find how huge it was. I have a Brother XL- 3750 and two machines could have fit in the case. More damage would have been done to the machine by banging around in the case than out of it. I returned it. I was also shocked to see the piece of metal that held the handle in place on the inside of the lid was rusted and it was supposed to be brand new. Too bad, but much too bulky.
Great stamps, high quality. The pink ink is a bright, highlighter pink, and my daughter a more visible ink color. But other than that, it is a great product! Very high quality and seems to hold up to frequent use.
I attempted to use the hook on a slightly delicate knitting project...not only did it keep tearing ALL MY YARN, it also bent within the first 5 minutes which boggled my mind as very little pressure was used. I found much better quality at my local craft store along with better prices. I will be returning his hook shortly.
This is a really nifty idea, and it works really well for making pleats, but I can not get it to gather. Everytime I put it on the setting for Gather it makes a big knot in one spot, and that's it. The instructions are very small, and not clear in my opinion. There is really no where that I have found for instructions online either. So unless you already know how to use this, or have someone who can show you I think you may end up very frustrated (like me).
Needed for button above zipper on a pair of jeans. Bought first package, tried all 4 and all 4 came apart. Thinking it might be a bad batch, went to a fabric store, bought another package, first one, same thing!Just ordered via Amazon:Guaranteed High Quality Brass Kit, 8 Set with Tool Jean Tack Buttonsby DIMEBUTTONS (Free Shipping, too)Will update the results.
I suggest you go through more pages to find exactly what you're looking for. There's a few of the pages I didn't use just because it made no sense! Why have green camo pages for the Navy? Most of them wear the aqua-flage?
This product was not what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be divided and it is just one compartment. It seems durable and of good quality so as long as that is what you are looking for then it is a good choice.
I would agree that the Simplicity BH600 does not take a long time to learn to use, but a better manual would really help. The instructions for threading are good, but not for other operational details. There are 3 knobs which can be adjusted to accommodate different fabrics, stitch length, depth, and thread tension. The manual tells you that much. However, it doesn't tell you what those things mean nor what the numbers mean or when you should turn the knobs which way.Take stitch length, for instance. On my old Singer machine stitch length meant the number of stitches per inch, and measured the distance the feed dogs moved the fabric per stitch. Higher numbers meant smaller stitches. On my Janome, stitch length refers to the number of millimeters the fabric moves per stitch the needle makes. Smaller numbers mean smaller stitches. I have no clue what the "stitch length" means on the BH600 or what is measured. The total information given is "Variable stitch length to customize the stitch for every fabric weight." Not a clue concerning what is measured (interval between stitches? length of the stitch from the edge of the fabric?) or when you should turn the dial one way or the other.Nevertheless, its compact size is very important for those of us who only need a blindhemmer once every couple of weeks, it stores very neatly in the box it ships in, and it worked well right away on the lightweight cotton the machine was set up for. I'm just afraid that it will be a bear when I have to try to figure out those knobs by trial and error.One year later: I would take away some stars at this point. The tension system is not at all robust in this machine. Even though I do not use the machine heavily, with months going by without using it, the tension mechanisms are totally shot. It started giving trouble just before the warranty was done and I contacted a certified shop to see about getting the machine worked on. I was told that the spring is a little weak, just take it out and stretch it a little. I did and that worked for a while, but it is pretty worthless now. I supplement the spring with a washer my husband found that is the right size, but the plastic knob that holds the tensioner parts together is also cracking.I would also not buy another straight needle hemmer. The problem with the straight needle is that a bar lifts the fabric up just as the needle is about to pierce the fabric. This tends to pull light-weight fabrics out of alignment, making the hem a little crooked unless you really fight it. All in all, I would not buy this machine again nor recommend it. Pay a little more and get a machine that is more robust and will work better.
I love Artbins -- I own 3 of them and will order more in the future as I need them. They're stackable, portable, lightweight, and I love that they are translucent so you can see what's inside instead of guessing. They keep my sewing and cross-stitch notions totally organized. The only drawback is that the organizer does not contain enough dividers for each available slot and its difficult to find/order replacement ones. Other than that one drawback, this is a 5-star product!
I ordered this set for my son's 4th birthday and he loves it. He eats, colors and plays at this table. The assembly was very easy. There was only one peice missing for the bins, but I called Kid Kraft and they sent me the missing peice without any problem.
I ordered and paid for two shields and only received one. I contacted the company, but have received no response.
This Swingline hole punch is easy to use and good for punching thick stacks of paper. It's sturdy, and the handle is well balanced. The ruler slides to adjust for any size paper, and the container holds a lot of holes before it needs to be emptied. It's a bit pricey, but worth every penny.
Ordered 4 rolls for $5 each. I thought they were bigger than they were so I had to order another 4. The price went from $5 to $5.50. Today the price is over $9. Something is wrong with this listing. Not too happy with purchase.
I was disappointed by this organizer. The latch doesn't stay shut, causing the thread to tumble out every time I picked it up.
I purchased this product to simplify longer cuts along a straight edge where a mounted cutter was too confining, and shears presented too many variances in the cut (potentially shaky operator influenced...).Pros: Good product, easy to use, reliable safety features, cuts well with thin material (paper thin)Cons: The product does not perform as well on heavier materials, and the blade can hang up on card stock thickness paper, which caused 'dimples' in the cut when the wheel failed to rotate completely (even with varying degrees of tightness of the mounting nut). It had no problems with thin sheet vinyl.Summary: Overall a good product for the price, works as expected, but if you have heavier stock to cut, consider a more robust rotary cutter with bearings and a deeper blade.
The Buddha Board is a surface that darkens when wet, then fades back to normal as it dries. It has "Buddha" in the name because it represents the evanescence of life (that everything is transitory). I have one in my office for people to write or draw on when they come in (with a wet brush - though the one that comes with it isn't good).
The glue worked well for my application -- repairing a fixture that is quite hot when it is in operation. The glue originally used in construction melted when it was turned on, but this one did not.
My toddler loves to paint so I knew these would be a big hit...and they were! We have used these at least 50+ times and they are still holding up. I wash them in cold water after each use and let them air dry. I have a rough and tumble toddler and he hasn't broken them yet.
My 4 year old is a horse nut, and while she enjoyed this product, it isn't one of the ones she asks to play with repeatedly. It has a nice selection of horses, and does provide great opportunity for creative play.
I purchased these scissors for my two year old. The first pair came off of the plastic so when you cut the metal part just moved up and down. The second pair teeth rub when you try and cut something. they were a good thought but my son has a hard time figuring out how they work.
What the packaging fails to say is that it takes this product about a month to make a semi-precious gemstone out of a rough rock. "But", they say, once you get inside to the instruction manual, "it takes Nature thousands of years to achieve this, and you can do it in just 30 days".IMHO, this is a part of Nature's job description, and she's got countless streams and brooks to do the work. They also get the job done a lot more quietly, and they clean up after themselves.In this imitation of life, you have to leave the tumbler running for almost a month, stopping only to clean out the gunk, wash the machine and chuck in a new size of grit. The motor only pulls 10 Watts, but the constant noise can be extremely irritating, and the clean-up is very messy.I don't know about you, but a month is much too long to produce a smooth stone that looks nothing like the fancy stones on the box, especially after enduring the noise, cleaning up the mess and answering ad nauseam the "Is it done yet?' question.As Jim Croce would have sang, if there were different lyrics for "Time in a Bottle"If I would shake stones in this tumblerThe first thing that I'd have to doIs to tumble away`til the thirty days passes awayJust to see them get smoothIf I could make kids wait foreverTo see if their gemstones come throughI'd spend every day with my earplugs and thenAgain, I'd go clean out the gooBut there never seems to be enough timeTo smooth the rocks you want to shineOnce you find themI've used the grit enough to knowIt oozes out through every holeAs it finds themIf I had a dime for each productThat works as you think it should doMy box would be emptyExcept for the memoryOf dimes from 1972In summary, forget this messy, noisy toy and go for a nature walk instead. It really is better not to mess with Mother Nature.Amanda Richards, December 30, 2007
I was very pleased with the items that I ordered. The company did a good job of fixing a mix up in shipment and it cost me nothing to rectify it. My husband is very happy with his 5 year Wedding Anniversay gift. Was exactly what he wanted.
For very light duty applications or apparel , this product is ok. However, about 10% were damaged and bent rendering them limited usefulness. The useful opening is barely 5/32 of an inch and the shoulder would easily pull through most fabric with little force. Definitely a decoration and very light duty low quality product.
The shipping of this product was extremely fast and the fact there was no shipping cost was one of the reasons for my purchase. However, the description of the product is misleading. It is described as a "heavy" paper, as opposed to some of the medium weights that are available. It is actually a thin, flimsy paper, not even close to durable or heavy. The quality of the paper did not meet my expectation of what I thought I was ordering based on the product description. Also, there was no invoice printout included in the shipment.
Cheap, does the work. It have a blue and red film which you can interchange to see the hearts and arrows. pretty cool. i used it to look the the diamond i bought. You will need to align the scope and your eye directly above the diamond else the image will be distorted
Just a review of the advertizement - It would help to have more details, like how long are these scissors?
Plastic didn't stick to the paper, only the sticky edge around it which wasn't much so it came apart easily.
I have started making clothes for myself and needed a way to avoid being stuck by pins during the fitting process. This dress form helps a great deal. It is rather flimsy, but it is fine for an amateur sewer like me.
These are terrific easy-to-use scissors, but useless to my 3rd-grade son for whom I bought them -- he refuses to take them to school because they arrived in magenta, instead of the blue shown. Kids care about stuff like that, so I think they should be specific about the color of "student" scissors...
I bought this paper for my college photography class and have loved it! The colors come out so vibrant and the paper is of a great quality. I would recommend this to others.
My son was very excited to get his new desk, but the construction is disappointing -- the slats of the rolltop are warped and only held together loosely by tape. We therefore are not able to raise or lower the top. Very disappointing!
I bought this machine to replace my 35-year old Singer Stylist and was surprised to learn that it was not as good! Of course being newer everything was a little smoother, but it has two problems that made it unacceptable to me. The first is that it requires constant - daily or weekly - oiling (my Singer only needed annual oiling) in 5 different places, some of which were not clearly indicated in the manual (brief and annoying to follow) and all of which were difficult to access. Also, pictures in the manual did not match the machine I received. The second big problem is that the it does not have a drop-in bobbin, something I thought surely would have become standard in the last 35 years! My old Singer had a drop-in bobbin and it is a feature I am not willing to give up.
This writer or paint worked great, but only shortly. The glow was very bright but faded after a few minutes. And it worked on different textures,like plastic, paper, tape, etc.
I purchased this embroidery machine with the promise that it was the newest and most innovative machine on the market. When this machine works it can be wonderful. However, it has broken every time I have used it. I have spent $100's of dollars on repairs. You can ONLY use Anton Robson Thread and only a certain type of bobbin thread. If you vary from this then the machine will break. Singer will NOT stand behind this product. They will continually claim it is the users fault for not using Anton Robson Thread. You absolutely cannot use any type of metallic thread on this machine or it will break. The automatic rewinding bobbin is wonderful...when it works! The dual thread feature is wonderful...when it works. Overall I have been very disappointed in this machine. It is very frustrating to me to have it break every single time I try to use it. I have wasted a small fortune in stablizers because the machine will quit working in the middle of a design and I have to take it to a dealer to get it fixed. I paid $6,500 for this machine and I would think that Singer would stand behind their product. However....they will not. Several dealers in Salt Lake refuse to carry this machine because of the the problems it has. I would have thought that Singer would want to keep their customers happy but they do not. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase this particular machine. Get a Brother, Bernina, Baby Lock, Viking or Janome. At least you have customer support and they will stand behind their products.
I bought this item to make decorations for my husband's send off party for his deployment. When it said 1 inch I was thinking that the star would be about the size of a quarter. But it's not. Its about the size of a penny. The description could be better for this item. However I did get it to work. I just had to change some things up a bit. And the product works great. I would have just bought a bigger size had I known how small this was.
Good set of markers. I used them for adult coloring books. Not good for stained glass type coloring pages as the wetness of the markers makes the page curl.
Work as designed. Eaiser to hold small parts when gluing into place. Much better than using fingers.
I bought this to use as hair chalk, and it worked pretty well. None of the pieces were broken when they arrived. For my first time trying it, I thought it worked out pretty well. I actually bought them for a friend with dark brown hair--they didn't show up as much in her hair as they did in mine (dirty blonde). The red and pink worked very well--brighter colors.
This yarn is wonderful to work with and easy to maintain a good shape for the project I was working on. The only negative I have is tht the color that I recieved was not what I saw on the computer screen. The green was more of a split pea soup green and I had wanted a more mellow green. It did work for another gift I was making for another relative, so it worked out alright.
I purchased the medium block punch, thinking I would have a 1" x 1" square.After receiving the punch, however, I find it is smaller. On the back of the package it says it is "1 cm/.625 inches" . First, I don't think 1 cm equals .625 inches. Second, there is nothing in the descriptions (here or elsewhere that I could find) saying it is 1" across DIAGONALLY. So if anyone is needing a 1" x 1" square, this is not it.Otherwise, the quality of these punches are fair. Not excellent, but they are handy and easy to use.
I really only bought this set for the plastic pizza wheel. Great basic set though. This set is very sturdy and it has survived a year with a 2 year old banging these pieces all around my home. =)
I ordered this set three years ago and hardly used it because the leads kept breaking. Some of my pencils a large chunk of the wood came off. I used to love Prismacolor colored pencils when my brother used them. Now I use acrylic paint and gouache paint and the best colored inks instead. I will never buy this brand of colored pencils again. I wasted my money.
Clearly Charming Coca Cola Bottle Cap Italian CharmThe caps are neatly made and so colorful. A very nice selection. They are the best.
My 11 year old daughter is having fun with this and has asked friends to join her to start a quilt business! We have ordered additional kits so she can add to her collection. It helps with their motor skills and is very durable.
Only one 1/8 x 1/8 strip comes in the box. even though the description seems to indicate otherwise. You can purchase a single strip of balsa wood in any hobby shop for less than .50CDO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
What makes this product so attractive is that by connecting it to a computer you can get an endless amount of embroidery designs. It is also a full feature sewing machine.I bought this item for my wife's birthday. It does everything that is advertised. The sewing functions are straight forward, and everything worked as it should.The embroidery isn't as staight forward. The instructions are very poor, and limited. Although I have to admit, that I figured most of it out fairly quickly. The embroidery is slow, and of course you have to change thread for every color change in your pattern. The designs came out looking good. I also downloaded some free designs from other sites, and they worked just as well.My problem with this machine is two fold. The one we bought broke after only a few hours of use. It was a minor problem. The bobbin holder had a crack where the tension screw goes in. At first everything was fine, but within a few hours the thread started catching in the crack until it was unusable. I'm sure that this won't be a problem for most customers.The second problem is much more severe in my opinion. No one has parts for the machine, and it's near impossible to even get a parts list. One item that doesn't come with the machine that my wife wanted was a zipper foot. The part number for that item was listed in the book, but when I went to find it, absolutely no one had it. I even wrote Singer's part's department, and they wrote back telling me to call.It's a neat machine. As long as you get one that works, and aren't concerned about parts availability, I don't think you can find a better ebroidery machine for less money.
compared to other products, this one's price is a bit lower, but you have to admit that the paper quality is not high-end. i mean it's not super thick or smooth or gross. but for family use, i think it's a reasonable price choice. usually, i print coupons, recipes, personal documents with this, so i'm fine. but for business use, you might want to look for more decent ones.
This gun heats nicely but drips constantly and is rather hard to clean up after. The stand is really useless.
arrived on time, however i was really disappointed that about 1/4th of the chalk was broken, quite a few to the point that they were unusable. there is a notice within the box that says that are not responsible for broken chalk because they "properly package" it to greatly prevent it from happening... well my chalk was only put inside of a boz with a poorly inflated bag, and it still had a whole bunch of room to slide around during shipping. besides that, the chalk works as i hoped. I have black hair with some blond in it and it worked well in both.
I am surprised about these scissor, from all the good reviews. They are big and bulky, and not good for precision cutting of paper at all. And it makes my hand hurt to use them unless you do small cuts a million times, and that takes forever to cut something out. Must be good for someone else but not for me. I am an art teacher and am cutting things out frequently, especially around holiday time.
I like this maching but the manual leaves a lot to be desired. Has anyone ever tried to use the alphabet or numbers?? I can get an embroidery hoop, as suggested, under the needle. Any help???
I was a little disappointed in this book because of the limitations in sizing. Although it is well presented, some of the projects are elementary enough that you can figure them out for yourself. But the two girls I was going to get the book for, one is an XS and the other is XL, there wasn't much in the book for either of them. And not a lot of direction on how to alter a pattern. "Teen Knitting Club" implies that is for ages 13-19 and there are quite a range of sizes in those years.
Took a little while to learn how to use this machine, but it's my first machine. It's great once you get used to it.
I have been looking all over the web for these 8 x 8 refill pages for my niece. This is the only place I have found them. Thanks so much for having them!
I bought this for my daughter last year for xmas and we got to play with it about twice before it fell apart.I really liked the idea of the pattern designs especially for my then 2 year old who just likes to paint mush lol. when we used the rollers to make the square designs it really didn't work. when the paint was on the roller it didn;t roll very well. I tried to dilute the the paint with water so the roller would work better but the sponges just didn't hold up.
Recieved first shipment with almost half of the order which was 3 boxes points falling out of box returned and ordered a new batch. Same problem not as much fell out but there is a problem with how they were packed.They were just thrown in a box no padding or packing material to keep the boxes from banging around and opening to where the points started falling out of the boxes.
If there stars is average, like a C in the classroom, then these are a D+ , C- !I dremel tool spins at a high rate, 20,000 rmps + , you need a balanced bit on the end of it! These do not meet that, it is a very simple device, a sleeve that fits over a rubber drum that is expanded via two washers and a bolt that buldge out the rubber drum to create a good, snug fit.First - the rubber drum has a hole that is off center, not by much, and the hole is too big. When you slide the madrel in the rubber drum there is play, as you tighten the screw to expand the rubber, the drum will move around and not tighten up, once you turn the screw with tremendous force the rubber will tighten, but it is out of balance, the drum when placed in the dremel tool vibrates a lot - it makes a buzzing sound that is caused by the eliptical orbit of the drum.good news - after fighting it a while, that is one of the ten drums for 20 minutes, I got it to get more or less in the center....still buzzes but it does sand.the sleeves seem to be well made, the rubber and hole alignment are the part that is frustrating.I will report back once I use the drums at length.Update:several of the drum sleeves have failed already. Once they get a little warm, they start to split and come apart.
We ordered 7 of these machines for our school sewing class, and each machine is in use approximately 1-2 hours per week. Upon receipt, one of the machines would not work, and we received a replacement. We have now been using the machines for about 6 weeks, and have consistently had problems with the bobbin casing dislocating and causing the needle to jam or break. The sewing instructor, who has extensive sewing experience, used the word temperamental to describe them and said that they are a nightmare for the frustrated students attempting to learn to sew. They were reasonably priced, but I guess you get what you pay for.
I was directed to this company by Carhart after telling them their rain jacket had lost its water repellency. I followed the directions to a &#34;Tee&#34;, but I still got wet in the next rain storm. I called Nikwax, they agreed I did everything correctly, and they're sending me more product. If that doesn't work, they said to send them the garment and they will analyze it. This was a two part process using their special wash. Kinda disappointing after spending $25.00 on a 3 year old $130.00 Carhart rain jacket
I found myself having to use two hands just to get the glitter glue out of the bottle. It was next to impossible to use it to spell a name for example or draw a picture. My six year old likes it because once I get on paper she can paint with it one of her paintbrushes.
Thick and goopy, doesn't mix/blend well, doesn't spread well over paper. Not recommended for large projects; might work better for smaller pieces.
this was a fun toy at first. My daughter was very excited to use it and make fun crafts. but after the first couple of stiches everything got jumbled up and nothing worked. we finally got the thread untangled but after that it just didnt work. my daughter was very disapointed. and now the $50 that we payed for a barbie sewing machine is sitting in our closet, broken. It may be fun for younger children, as a pretend sewing machine, but if u really want to learn, dont get your hopes up with this toy!
As I said, this protects the screen, but there's no real glare reduction as I'd hoped for. fit my hp pavilion dv6 very well. pain to put on, DEFINITELY need TWO people.
Took me some time to get around to it, but once I got it out of the box it was easy peasy... The 2 CDs were quite inspiring and helpful. Threading was intimidating, at first, but that is only temporary. It's easier than I thought.Would recommend it as a first machine as there are so many uses for it, and it's EASY to learn on.- L.E.
my kids have shown a super interest in play dough the last few months. I have been purchasing items to help them play and explore. I have a 4 yr old and 3 yr old twins. I put these tools out with the others and they showed no interest. I tried to show them how they could use them, but they prefered other items they had to choose from. Not sure why....I though they were fun!
I've been sewing for many years, and when my Viking quit working I researched for several weeks to find a reasonably priced and good quality machine. The reviews on this Brother were mostly good, and for how I use it (making clothes for my granddaughter and her doll)it sounded like it was just what I needed. I've been using it daily for 3 weeks, and don't have a single complaint. I love the self threading feature and the start button. The buttonhole maker works like a charm, the decorative designs I've used so far give the clothes a really nice touch and are so easy to use. My thanks to all who put in their reviews, helping me make a good choice!
This hole punch was a grave dissapointment. First, don't expect to punch more than 4 sheets of paper at a time. Secondly, there is no way to make a hole in the center punch. I don't know another reason to need a 7-hole punch except to add pages to a daytimer . . . I still have to punch one hole manually because there is a gap in the middle where you cannot add a hole punch.
I needed something that wasn't an eye sore for my Cricut. I wanted this to be in our sunroom, so out in the open for our company to see. When I found this online, i had to have it! I found it at Fleet Farm for $119. My husband assembled it in under an hour. He commented that this was the sturdiest piece of furniture that he has ever put together...and we have assembled a lot. He said all the pieces matched up, so there was no wiggling to try to make things work. So for $119, this is MORE than worth the money. The shelf on the bottom in the middle section, is a PERFECT fit for my cricut when i want it put away. the little storage bins on the door, fit two cartridges in each section. i think there are 4 sections on each shelf. the shelves on the right side, are perfect for paper. if you are tight on space and need a desk for a cricut....this is a MUST HAVE! it's like it was made for it. way to go Sauder!!
I'm a firm believer in that reviews are written by unhappy and unsatisfied people. When you got home from a nice dinner, you didn't race to the computer with joy to write a beautiful review for your local establishment, so I just want to start out by saying that I am obviously not the latter. I ordered the embossers after reading the reviews and wondering just how hard could it be to get it right?! I was sadly mistaken. I ordered this as a gift and thank goodness I ordered it two months in advance! I got the 1st order (please keep count) relatively fast but it was wrong, I order black, not silver. When I called the number, the girl answering wasn't very pleasant and told me to keep the plates and that they would send me out the new 'black' embossers. After about two weeks I emailed the girl about when it was sent out and she sent me the UPS receipt for the first one I ordered. Very on top of things. When I finally did receive the 2nd order...(AUGH!) They were black all right, but about 2 inches smaller than the ones I ordered, so the plates she told me to keep didn't even fit because they were for the wrong one! I called her and she told me that they would start ALL OVER! and resend me everything. I made her assure me that they would be for the original size that I ordered, in black and that the plates would fit. She assured me everything would be fine. I emailed her a few days ago, again wondering where the embossers might be and got a confirmation that they would be arriving today....they did...(3rd Order) and I am here to inform you that they plates are right, they are in the color black like I had originally ordered yet they are the mini size. Just peachy. I'm seriously exhausted in dealing with her/them. I did email her today telling her that I was slightly disappointed. Her email back said that she's sorry but they black ones are smaller now, manufacturer of course. Kind of wish she would have told me that before, I probably would have kept the silver ones. And now I don't have any more time to be messing around with it since the birthday is coming up soon. If you're interested in purchasing, please make sure you have months to wait to make sure it's right. But I do have to say on a lighter note. The embosser is a very good quality and it embosses nicely. Worth the hassle again though... probably not.
Was hoping for small frames meant for hanging, not standing on a shelf, as I find the &#34;stand&#34; gets in the way of proper hanging alignment. These frames, unfortunately, have the stand and therefore will be returned.
I purchased this machine about a week ago and it came in the mail 5 days ago. According to the reviews it is presented as a pretty good machine for the cheap price. But as the saying goes...You get what you pay for...after hooking up the machine and sewing on it for 2 days.This machine is re-packaged headed back to the "refund' Department. It sews very hard (not smooth) the thread was bunching up and getting caught. The worst part was trying to sew a standard pair of jeans and the needle broke. Then after switching to a heavier needle, the machine kept reading "error". If you have very light weight things to sew with cheap fabric then this could be a good machine. If you like to take in or reconstruct store ready garments then PLEASE save your money and invest in something a litle more durable. This machine received 3 stars because it has some cool features (computerized features) like sewing without the foot pedal, one-touch needle button....the machine is cheaply made and you can tell this by the weight and the accessories of the machine. Not durable at all. I went yesterday and purchased a Viking 116 machine and the differences between the Viking (top of the line) and this Brother machine aren't even comparable.
The scissor is alright, but nothing to rave about. Its a scissor for gods sake. Its just not that high-tech.
this will only work if the material that is needing a new button is relatively thin otherwise it will not attach the button at all
I did allot of research on the type of serger I intended to add to my sewing room tools. I was looking for a 4 thread serger that would be both economical and efficient. The CD that accompanied the machine was wonderful. I took the machine out of the box and began serging. The instruction manual was right there beside me and easy to follow. Reading the directions is imperative.I ordered my Brother 1034D serger through Amazon.com. It arrived in less than 4 days.I am totally satisfied with my purchase! This is a great serger for the money!Now the doll clothes I sew looks completely professional!
I purchased the Blade Runner out of a need for a tool that would accurately cut circles out of cardstock. I build card models, and it's particularly difficult to cut perfect circles between about 1/4" to 1 & 1/4." (Larger can look passable freehand with a blade or with scissors, or with specialty circle cutters, while smaller can be done with metal punches.)I have a drafting circle template that I wanted to somehow use with a cutting tool that would not risk cutting the template itself. The Blade Runner works well for this.The Blade Runner is designed to be used with templates; it has a guide shaft to which the blade is attached, much like the pilot on a piloted router bit. The Blade Runner's instructions direct the user to place the template sheet on something to raise it up a few millimeters, like some sticky putty. The blade guide then hooks under the surface of the template in order to guide the user.For my own purposes, I needed the template flush with my parts sheet in order to cut the exact outline of the part. I found that, by using a larger diameter circle in my template sheet to offset, I could use the Blade Runner's tiny circlular blade housing like a "pilot" without having to hook under the template sheet. By carfully making 2 to 3 light pressure passes, I get very good results with only slight fraying that easily brushes off.One of the things that makes this tool unique is the extremely low profile of the blade itself, allowing the user to get as close to the surface of the cutting media as possible.Another nice plus is that replacement blades are available from the manufacturer. I purchased my Blade Runner at a Michaels craft store, and they had the replacement blades in stock.I would recommend this tool to anyone who does paper crafts with templates and has a fairly steady hand for cutting jobs.
Like other buyers, while this item is clearly labeled a PACK OF SIX, we only received ONE canvas. Website description, packing label, picture all indicate 6. Why would there only be 1?Note: I did contact Amazon customer service and they issued a refund, but it is a hassle to re-order, etc. And I still don't know if we'll get six next time.
The picture showed color of backs as white, but received clear. These were purchased for an older person who uses reading glasses to see. The clear colored backs are almost impossible to see, in fact they are so clear they are extremely difficult to see if they drop on the floor. Perhaps the white colored are better. Also, these are so small that it is difficult for older person with arthritis or dexterity challenged to use. These are smaller than the ones available in Claire stores.
I bought this for my wife, and it broke soon after. If you have the money go for something more durable
I was a little skeptical when I ordered these, but I thought, "Meh, if they suck, they were cheap and they're a good back up for lost needles." I was very pleasantly surprised! Yes, they are not Clover brand. They are also not $13 a set. I have been using these for about a year, and I find them to be just fine. And for the price, they are better than just fine.
I have had this machine for several months. I LOVE it. It totally defies the "you get what you pay for" way of thinking, because it costs so little yet works well. I keep it clean (with vacuum cleaner and also compressed air to blow out debris) and oiled and it works flawlessly. All adjustments and settings are easy to implement. Some people find overlock machines difficult to thread, and recommend tying old to new thread rather than re-threading the machine. This machine is SO easy to thread, I find re-threading to be faster and more simple. Yes you have to use tweezers in a few places but they are provided and once you get the hang of this machine, it goes very quickly. The lower looper threader is very easy (watch the included video clips).After using this machine for several months, I wanted something with more capabilities and was very disappointed with other machines I tried: the Viking s15 and the Singer ProFinish (which although vastly different in price are mechanically the same machine, made in the same factory but with different plastics and included accessories) -- both of which were terrible (unreliable, mechanical problems). Trying inferior (and yet more expensive) machines made me realize what a great value the Brother 1034D is. It can't do everything, but it does a lot -- and very reliably.The only negatives are: it's a bit noisy compared to a regular sewing machine, if you're not used to that -- BUT it works twice as fast, so that shouldn't be a big deal; and there's only one screw for both needles so removing one while keeping the other in place (to do a 3-thread vs. 4-thread overlock) requires a bit of dexterity, but is not so bad once you're accustomed to it. Also because of the design of the machine your stitches are limited to the edge of things (there's no room to the right of the needles/loopers, even with the cutter disengaged).For those who want to sew stretchy fabrics or otherwise want their projects/garments to look professional, without spending a fortune, this is the machine you want.
Fiskars is a company known for many types of cutting devices in many arts and crafts. I have had the same pair of fiskars scissors that have kept their sharp blade and easily cut through yarn and fabric. When I needed a rotary cutter to get more accurate cuts in fabric, there was never a second thought to which brand I'd go for. Unfortunately, the rotary cutters just don't live up to the reputation.I've gone through several blades quite quickly. The first few cuts are super sharp, and when I first used the rotary blade, I really had to be careful not to cut like a drunken sailor and cut more than I planned or myself! So naturally, I initially was impressed with the cutting ability. But then after just a few small projects, I noticed that the blade had one particularly dull spot that caused skipping. Now that I am on my third blade after maybe cutting several yards each, the same thing keeps happening. It's getting annoying.It gets the job done, but with the number of blades I could go through I might spend my money on another brand.UPDATE: About 1 month after I wrote the above review, I dropped this rotary cutter on my foot. The blade was unsheathed and I was barefoot. I was working with a blade that I would have categorized as "dull", however, the slip of my hand required a trip to the emergency room. I lacerated the top of my foot quite badly, requiring some stitches. Thinking that this was a run of the mill laceration (it made quite a nice straight edged cut for them to stitch back up), it wasn't immediately noticed that this "dull" blade I was working with severed nerves and a tendon to my big toe. Several months later, my big toe "drops" and is unable to move on it's own. I also have significant neurological symptoms along the side of my foot and toe from the damage. I tell all of this because I think my initial review could have led people to believe that these rotary blades dull like a butter knife. In fact, they may dull significantly in terms of cutting through fabric, but a dull blade can do some major damage to you!
I have been looking for a new sewing machine for a while. I didn't mind spending the money because I do a lot of sewing. I looked in stores and I looked on line and I read lots of reviews and recommendations. After all that I decided on this machine and it really is the best machine I have ever owned. And it was very reasonably priced!! The shipping was so fast too. I received the machine in 2 days and I didn't get the 2 day shipping. I love my machine and Amazon has been great!
I purchased this set of double points (as well as some circulars and straights from the same company) not long after I started knitting. I've read a number of reviews glowing about how wonderful the needles are and that they are comparable to Clover needles. There is really not much of a comparison as the Clover needles are by far a higher quality than these. These needles are not nearly as smooth as other bamboo needles - these needles seem to be more porous - it seems like they need additional sanding or some wax to smooth them out. It is sometimes difficult to get the yarn to slide off the needles, even though I tend to be a loose knitter. The smaller size needles (3 and below) are very flimsy, so I wouldn't recommend using these for sock knitting. Some of the needles I've used have gotten splintery which causes the yarn to catch on the needle.On the positive side, if you typically just need double point needles for small projects such as decreases on hats, or just getting the center started on a circular piece of knitting such as a pi shawl, then these might be a good purchase for you. These may also be good for knitters that worry about dropping a needle or stitches with slippery DPNS. You can't beat the price - which is the main reason I'm giving it 3 stars - any more expensive and I'd be giving them a 2.PS: I think that there is someone out there (most likely from the manufacturer or distributor) who has been noting negative reviews for these products as "unhelpful".
Plain Frame. Okay for poster. I just bought one to frame a free Nationals poster so did not care too much on what it looked like or anything. The border of my frame was fine, but the clear plastic (glass) was broken in 3 of the corners. Again, not a big deal for me....seeing as I was framing a free poster. I just put some ticket stubs in the corners to cover up the broken plastic rather than sending back a $20 frame.
The shipping of this product was extremely fast and the fact there was no shipping cost was one of the reasons for my purchase. However, the description of the product is misleading. It is described as a "heavy" paper, as opposed to some of the medium weights that are available. It is actually a thin, flimsy paper, not even close to durable or heavy. The quality of the paper did not meet my expectation of what I thought I was ordering based on the product description. Also, there was no invoice printout included in the shipment.
Patches didnt iron on well, didnt stay on at all. Came off in wash. will never buy this useless product again.
I bought 6 of these bottles from FindingKing as they are described as "Acid Bottles" They arrived very quickly and that was the only good thing about the order. None of the tops seal. . . not very safe for acid use. One of the tops had a square cut top to fit into a round hole. . NOTThe glass dippers were another story. One was so long the top would not even fit the bottle. The others were so short the bottle would have to be half full in order for the dipper to reach the liquid.I contacted FindingKing and was told to return for a full refund. Off to the Post Office and $10.20 shipping to return $13.98 worth of bottles. Now it cost me $3.78 to shop with FindingKing.I e-mailed customer service and they responded to now throw away the bottles and I would receive a full refund. Hummm the told me the day before I had to return the product.I contact customer service again and was told they needed to have a copy of my ship receipt. Did that and was told President of Company needed to sign refund check. . . .unless I wanted a refund via PayPal. That was 10 days ago still no return shipping refund.Save your money and find something else for "Acid"
Upon finishing a large project, I noticed there were fibers stuck in the grooves of the mat. Having to pluck the lot of them out was a major pain in the backside. Thankfully there is a backside to this mat and I am able to work on the different color.
I was very pleased with this little sewing machine. I'm a guy, and I know nothing about sewing, except that I was tired of sewing little holes in my clothes by hand. I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on a big, fancy machine. This one is pretty basic, and there are a couple places where the instructions could've been clearer. But after sewing up a hole in some pants within 10 minutes of opening the box, I felt very happy with my purchase.
Windsor Newton masking fluid is a bit of a disappointment. It goes on clumpy, no matter how I treat the brush / stylus, and dries so quickly that it often binds the stylus just trying to blend lines. Unless the underlying art has dried COMPLETELY (like overnight), the masking fluid tends to lift the color underneath it, even with permanent watercolors, even if the fluid is lifted later in the day (ie, it wasn't left there for weeks before lifting).Overall, I'm not impressed, and will be looking for a new masking fluid with easier application and better response to underlying colors.
The glue gun I received was the H-280 40 watt gun, as the title page descriptor states. However, that's one of the few accurate description of the glue gun on the page. The picture is of a different glue gun. The product features stated for the glue gun include:Product FeaturesComes with auxiliary stand - not the one shown. It's a plastic ring that attaches to the handleNon slip / Non stick finish - no, just normal plasticOn/Off switch with light - no switch, no lightHigh output - 60 watts - no, it's 40 wattsUses standard .43 dia glue sticks - yesLater in the sentence descriptors it says it has an 8ft cord. It's actually a little over 4 ft.I haven't tried the glue gun yet. I'm upset the description of what I thought I was ordering was not correct and that the product I received was inferior to the one described.
very overpriced i think. the wool itself is fine.it arrived on time but was in a huge box filled with plastic bags.
Item is not at all what is in the photo or what's described. Product was all metal, rusty and old!
Pinking shears are a necessity for anyone who sews. They cut a zig-zag edge, which helps prevent fraying. Whether you're working with fragile fabrics, or making doll clothes with narrow seam allowances, or just want a clean finish to your garment seams--you'll need a pair of pinking shears in your toolbox. I recommend them to all of my students.These pinking shears in particular are great. The handles are soft and the automatic spring action is a lifesaver. With regular pinking shears, you have to open and shut the blades with every stroke. This might not seem like much trouble, but pinking shears are heavier than regular scissors and more difficult to use. If you have any kind of arthritis in your hands, you'll want a pair with the spring action. Or even if you just have a large project ahead of you, with lots of fabric to be cut out. You'll be grateful for the spring action by the time you're done.That said, these pinking shears are a bit touchy. On average, they seem to last about three years before needing replacement. This is my third pair in ten years, but then again, I do cut a lot of thick fabrics, like denim and twill. They really don't like that. They'll do the job, but they get stuck at times and you have to pry the blades open.For those who aren't aware, they do require cleaning and oiling to keep the spring action running smoothly. Use a pipe cleaner to dust in between the blades, then place a drop or two of sewing machine oil onto the round part between the blades, near the handle. Then act as if you're cutting something, so the oil can work its way into the gears. Make sure you cut a piece of scrap fabric with them after oiling, so you don't accidentally drip any excess oil onto your nice fabric. A sign that they're getting old and need to be replaced is that the spring action stops working and you find yourself oiling them constantly, trying to get them to work.I give them four stars, because they are a pain to use when the blades stick. And you'd think they'd last longer than three years without needing to be replaced. But they're such a necessity in the sewing room, you really can't live without them. Highly recommended!
Be careful with these, because the ink will NOT stay on! It smears very easily, and is definitely NOT waterproof! It washes off right away. I even tried coating it with water-resistant spray, and it still didn't work. Such a disappointment.
I purchased a number of these machines to resell and have had problems with 2 out of 5. One truly had a mechanical problem and the other did not come with a manual! This is very inconvienent for reselling since I am responsible for a product that is said to be OK except for cosmetic problems. There were more problems than that!
I purchased these for my daughter. She uses them often in her artwork, and they have everything she needs for Xacto knives. I like the box and the way that they are stored.
I purchased this item when looking for a source for good quality colored wool. I love the wool but was disappointed when I found the exact same thing at Michaels for about $4.50 (regular price). If you don't have a source near you, this would be a good option but if you have a craft store that actually carries wool felting supplies, I'd check there first.
nice,reaLLY GOOD quality product,buy it,, my relative will be so excited.......to get this as a gift ...really awesome ,wonderfulAwesome
This is my favorite ruler when cutting fabric for quilts. Along with the June tailor shape cut ruler. This will help to have extra fabric when I need it.
The burgundy turned out amazingly in this, it was exactly what I needed. Unfortunatly the frosting tasted stale and old, when I know it was fine beforehand. Work on the flavor, keep the great coloring.
This is a really cute cartridge but I never used it. I hated the uppercase B as it is top heavy and I thought it looked strange. I think this is one that would be good for baby or kid projects though.
Our oldest child had been wanting to learn Origami so we got this for him to learn with and we now have an Origami making machine. Only knock is that the paper is same color both side (traditional Origami paper is white on the back) but that doesn't affect most things you do.
I've had this Quartet easel for a few months now holding up a flipchart for a few hours once a month. I was initially disappointed to see it uses twist-locks on the legs, but I thought it would only be an annoyance. Wrong. Despite being careful/gentle with my twists, the 2nd time I used it and tried to collapse the legs when done, I needed to use pliers to loosen the twist-lock on one leg. And now, a month later pliers wouldn't even work to loosen and collapse TWO of the legs.Note: Prior to this one I had the lighter weight version that used cam click locks for the legs. I loved that one, but I lost it somehow and THOUGHT I'd be upgrading to get this heavier-duty version. Boy was I wrong.
Although having an ultra thin spatula is a must when using the Cricut, I find that this product could use some improvement. During the first use, I already noticed how the spatula would also pick up the adhesives from the mat, and that's probably not good for the longevity of my mat. Also, I would prefer that the spatula blade be longer, especially when working with a larger piece. But for the price on Amazon, it's better than buying this tool at a craft store.
I got tired of having thing fall off of my fridge so I purchased these. They are super strong! Almost hard to get off though. I would def buy them again though. I wish I had more to construct cool things on my fridge...Pros: Super strong!Finish that dosn't come offDecent amount in the packageCons: Small!Hard to get off due to strength and size.
Somehow, for the price, I didn't expect this to be so well made. It's solid, even a bit heavy, and very well-made.
It's a leaker...I need to keep the spout over a small container or it drips all over everything.
I used it on a small thin metal button for pants and I tried and tried and it never did fasten. I have not tried it with the small plastic buttons they supplies possibly it works with it but they will not fasten pants. I was disapointed.
the product is nice, BUT the fabric is plain blank, so, u have to use the chart which is on the paper. count and figure out yourself everything.. which i don't like since it will take forever!!! i like preprinted fabric with the design to follow. it's much easier, more fun and faster. i am gonna return it
Purchased product to remove scratches from my glasses. (Had read on eHow that this was effective) It didn't make the situation was, but didn't do what I hoped. Probably works fine for intended use.
I am new to the Cricut world and when shopping for items found they were a little high price. Reviewed Amazon and found this bundle and it is a good deal! Once I got the item, found out that the cutting mats were for the Cricut and not for the Cricut Essential machine. Contacted the company and they would not swap the 6X12 for the 12X12 mats without me spending lots more money. I think they could of swapped with me and I pay the postage but there was no negotiating.
bought this machine from Wallmart when my old serger broke in the middle of sewing a project. Did not read any reviews until after I had sewn on it. I found it excellent, and much less in price than I had expected to pay. I bought my first serger in the 70's a Juki and it was a devil to thread - traded it in . for a MyLock in about 85 - neither of them had differential feed . I like this one lot and think it is a good value .
I was searching for a good dye for nylon, the product says it is great. I tried it, did everything it asked, and no good results, poor product.
This is a decent product. I own one myself. The only problem I have, is that some small objects can move to different compartments if the container is moved around.The real issue is the price. It's ridiculous. I bought mine at my local Walmart for about $10-$12. Also, it is nowhere near 15.2 pounds. I'd say it's well under 5 pounds.
This review relates to the product named "50 Steel Split Rings Key Chain Connector Parts 20mm", sold by FindingKing.I should have taken note of the review by Brian Hughes dated June 10, 2010. I had the same experience as Brian.The metal quality lacks sufficient tensile strength for its intended use.Once a key has been put on a ring, the ring is permanently deformed.Exactly as Brain Hughes stated "... they end up sprung -- the layers don't spring back together ...".At any price this product is defective. Amazon should delete this product from its website. Why does Amazon allow this defective product to stay on its website for 18 months?
This is a great tool to help those of us who are color challenged! I bought it to use for home decorating ideas and to know what colors look good together. The front of the wheel shows the color groups and it explains; one-color scheme,two-color scheme, multi-color schemes, and related (analogous) colors. The back has a full description on how colors work together. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about color.
My only experience with self-healing mats are those made specifically for fabric, so maybe this doesn't apply if you're buying it for another purpose. This mat is nicely made and has clear markings. The problem is it is really hard and so doesn't really &#34;heal&#34;. I've used it to cut about fifty quilt squares and it now has a mark where I was cutting. Because of this, I'm also a little concerned about how quickly it will dull my rotary cutter.
I expected a better quality product for the price I paid for this item. It comes in a very cheap container that does not hold the contents securely. Appears to be made from cardboard. Very poor quality. The brush hairs are already coming out and it hasen't even been used yet. It was also packaged poorly and arrived soaking wet. The paper that comes along with this product was also poor quality.
The color of these foil is great but it says that its thin so I expected just colored foil without paper on the back. So I dont know if there is out there just colored foil or not but this one is not what I needed.
Purchased these to go along with Play Doh play sets for toddler. Fun to add to the set. Great price.
I purchased these pencils after an extensive search for a former "Spectracolor Design" colored pencil now no longer produced by Faber Castell. Finding an artist-grade pencil in a well-blended crimson color was a requirement for an alternative colored pencil for my search. I purchased a box of twelve.Upon the shipment's arrival, I promptly began preparing the pencils using a high-quality artist's pencil sharpener. Time after time and to my frustration, I found the pencil lead would only disintegrate in the sharpener, making it impossible to produce a proper 'point' to the pencil lead. I tried a number of other sharpeners, only to have the same effect.Clearly, the leads of this brand (or batch) of pencil are defective in either manufacture or design. A pencil without a point isn't worth much - whatever the intended use.STRONGLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS PRODUCT.
I have just tried it on 2 cycles with the Ultrasonic machine I purchased on Amazon for $25. It does work!. I have a 10X eye Loupe magnifier and if you own one ( you can buy an eye loupe from a jewelry store for $10-$15), you can see immediately how much cleaner your jewelry is.Before that I tried cleaning also on 2 cycle with hot water and dishwashing detergent. No comparison. The solution made a big difference.
I bought this machine because of the many good reviews, and because a hard case/cover was included. The case is more cover than case, as the machine is not enclosed by the cover, and the cover has no handle, just a hole in the back where you can stick your hand in to carry the machine, much like carrying a cube of soda cans.The machine can be carried in this fashion because it is incredibly light.With only the guidance of the included instruction booklet, my non-sewing daughter was able to wind a bobbin, thread the machine, and try a few decorative stitches. She thought the speed adjustment was a good feature.
Don't know if Olfa's are any better, but I can tell you that unless you buy a blade sharpener, plan on spending boo-coo bucks on blades just to finish your quilt. And don't drop your rotary cutter on a hard floor, the blades will be totally messed up after that. I'm sure that's true with any rotary cutter, so be careful.
I was speechless when I opened the Amazon box to find this tiny package of wool. I guess I don't know what 20g of wool looks like. Before you buy, see the photo I posted so you'll know what you're getting.
Overall this is a fairly good machine.PROS:The regular and decorative stitches held their consistancy a lot better than the more expensive Brother model and it was not necessary to change feet for different stitches.Price.CONS:However...that darned 'ol buttonhole thing was doing its aggravation to me and jamming as it did in the more expensive Brother model.This time I called Brother and they tried to help me over the phone. That did not work. Next I took it to a Brother service center. After working with it and having difficulty as I did with the buttonholer, the service man was finally able to "tweek" it a bit and the buttonholer worked. Well, somewhat. One side was beautiful but the other side of the buttonhole used less thread and did not look so good. That effort in itself took going over the buttonhole twice. Also, he told me it was a "cheap" machine and I could expect no better. (Of course, he had some much more expensive Singers and Janomes for sale at his shop!!!Naturally I tried them out and liked the more expensive computerized ones, who wouldn't?)After getting it home, it still gave me problems with the buttonhole thing. Thinking operator difficulty??? I really hate to admit that!Why all this focus on a buttonholer? I like to make my little "let me do it myself" granddaughter , 4 yrs., clothes with buttons so she can dress herself rather than zippers that require someone else to help.Plus, it should just work and not be so difficult!!!Well, I am going to look at some Singer models this week and depending on the overall picture, might be sending this one back.
I love the serger it is everyting I thought it would be. Instructions are clear and easy to understand. The company I bought it from has wonderful customer service.
My boyfriend purchased for me, I was delighted! But as soon as you open it, the thread just falls out, there is nothing to hold them in, everytime i opened it I had to spend fifteen minutes cleaning up. So the carrying case is almost useless, maybe it can work left open on your sewing table, and I don't know if its worth it for the thread, but it is the worst design ever. If anyone can tell me any ways to use this and without the spools of thread falling all over the place when opened, I'd love to hear. It is a waste of space.It should be half the price.I don't blame Amazon, this is Singer taking advantage of us sewing fanatics that love nifty accessories!
I like this pattern but not the color choice so I changed it to a pink and burgundy haven't finished it yet so no pictures.
I've had my Epson photo printer for several years, and so have purchased several of these print packs. Not once has the ink lasted long enough to use up even half of the included paper. Luckily, I have a friend with a photo printer that doesn't require a bundled purchase of ink/paper, so I can give my surplus paper to her. That doesn't assuage my feeling that I'm being ripped off by having to buy paper I don't need, though....
After tiring of cheap lighters, I went for this one, after hearing how "great" they were. WRONG! After failing to light after 20 or so clicks, it finally lit and then refused to go out. Nothing worked but finally submersing it in water, and leaving it until all the propane vented. Ten weeks of off and on reliability and then kaput. A total waste of good money.
I thought for sure this came with the latch hook needed to do this project and it did not...where is it?
It diffinately was not the color shown on the screen but I will keep it anyway because the shipping costs so much. Thanks anyway.
I had a very expensive cashmere sweater that I wanted to change the color, I'll admit I was a little sceptical at first. I had never dyed anything with an acid dye before. It's quit a different process than regular dying,but I read the directions carefully and forged ahead It turned out amazing I now have a brand new sweater.
This is a must have for anyone that sews. I bought this, this particular time for some dog collars I was making, it's the perfect width for the ribbon I had picked out and I have never had a problem with this product in any project I've used it for.
This is a GREAT machine for a beginner. I've just finished my first couple of projects and I'm very happy with the results.Likes: easy to operate, many great features, helpful diagrams on the machine, operation is very smooth, the light in the machine is very helpful for meDislikes: The owner manual skips between English and Spanish. It is VERY difficult to follow if you don't already know how to operate a sewing machine, the screws are VERY TIGHT from the factory, so if you need to remove the metal plate to clean the machine, you're going to need a pair of needle-nosed pliers, a nickel (the screwdriver doesn't fit), and A LOT of muscle. I laughed when I read the "warning" in the instruction manual that says not to tighten the screws too tight -- as if that's possible.Since I only speak English, I used a thick black crayon and blacked-out the Spanish in the manual. That made reading the instructions much easier. Anything that you have trouble with regarding this machine can be solved with a youtube video -- at least that's what I've found so far. Overall, I highly recommend this machine. I do not find the plastic housing to be cheap or flimsy. I am so happy I purchased this product.
I had expressed an interest in a sewing machine to do some small sewing projects, not wanting too much for gadets and fancy stiches. I have worked on two projects now and have not found the right tensions or something because it is not sewing well. The stitches are not tight, it is jamming, threads getting caught underneath in the bobbin casing, and threads breaking. The instructions for stitches are well described, and does all the stitches I will need for simple dresses and clothing. Maybe it is just user error, but a friend and I sat down with the machine in order to give me some lessons and she was not able to help me fix my problems very well, so we switched and used her machine. I will keep with it for awhile and see if I can work out my problems, but think I may be returning it for something else.
This is the first time I have used a glass cutter, but did not want a plastic one. I do not know how this compares to other cutters, but I simply filled it with oil, and started cutting as I saw in some youtube videos. I cut straight edges, I cut curves, and I did not cut my fingers. So thumbs up! Remember to smooth sharp edges and vaccuum up small glass shavings/dust.
It's a piece of junk. Doesn't work properly by following the instruction. If you want to buy a real scissors sharpener, go to Walmart or BedBath&Beyond.
I guess you get what you pay for. This glass cutter didn't perform as expected. I still had to purchase a heavy duty one at the local hardware store.
Last night at 8pm, right at the start of Glee, I opened the huge square box that my Brother serger machine came in. It was nicely packed and the machine was much bigger than I had imagined. It came prethreaded with corresponding threads to the 4 color coded thread passages. It came with a CD to view on my PC. I paged thru the book for 10 minutes to familiarize myself with things and then popped the CD in my computer. I only watched the first 5 lessons as I didn't want to go into overload trying to process things I didn't need to get started. I will go back to watch those videos when I need those features. I watched the threading lesson 3 times. Then I set the machine up on my kitchen table. It was 9pm. It took me 15 minutes to thread the machine with my own new white large spools. I purchased 4 white and 4 black. Even though it takes regular spools of thread, I figured I would stock up on the 2 colors that I would use the most. And @ $2.99 each, they were a bargain and ensured I would not run out of thread for a while. I used the tie on method that is explained in part on the enclosed video. Finally satisfied and confident that I was ready to start, I gently pushed the accelerator to stitch on some scrap fabric. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the machine ran and the speed and ease of mobility. The default tensions settings worked for me so I didn't touch them, but I did experiment a bit with the stitch length and width settings. So here's the good news. By 9:25, (one hour and 25 minutes total) I had begun to sew the bodice and belt ties of DGD's christening gown. I really like the machine and encourage those of you who have one, but like me were overwhelmed to get started, to do just that. Open it up and see what it can do. To those who have always thought of buying a serger, I say do it.There are a couple things that I feel need improvement though.1. The video and the manual contradict each other regarding the How To Thread process. This is the most important thing on a serger - getting it threaded correctly - and it's not 100% clear. The manual says to ALWAYS thread the Upper Looper, Lower Looper, Right Needle and Left Needle IN THAT ORDER. In the video, the instructor starts with the left needle. I think it would be helpful to remember the following sequence (using the color code) that occurred to me last night. GBPY - GaBippy! Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow is the threading order.2. The seam allowance guide is not explained anywhere that I could see. Being an experienced sewer, I kinda figured it out, but I could see how it could be a problem for beginners. The raised bolded line to the right of the needle is the standard 5/8" seam allowance. The line to the left is either 3/8" or 1/2" and then the one closest to the needle is either 3/8" or 1/4". I will have to measure the stitching with the knife blade recessed in order to get a more accurate definition of the seam allowance guide.3. The manual says to oil your machine, but then does not include the oil.4. The machine gets filled with lint from the fabric very quickly. I recommend getting a can of compressed air (available @ office supply stores) and give it a good blow out after you're done sewing.
This stuff is addicting to use! It works well, goes on easily, and looks nice. Works best when warmer. I used it on retro brass knobs on my grandparent's old dresser. It makes the whole thing look new! I also used it on varnished wood in a couple spots, with no issues. A little bit goes a very long way. Well worth the price.
Well this product does a good job at cleaning and seems to be a bit better then simple green, However the one thing I did not like about this purchase is that the shipping and Handling cost more than the product, What gives?? I just don't understand this but the cleaner is good.
A lot has changed since I used my grandmother's 1948 Singer in high school. New technology makes this machine so easy to use right out of the box. Excellent value, too.
I ordered this product for a book making class I was taking. A japanese book drill was on the list of supplies. This item was described as heavy-duty and it is anything but. The add statedHeavy Duty Screw Punch...This heavy duty screw punch puts perfectly clean holes into board and paper for bookbinding.It jammed the first time I used it and wouldn't even go through the book board. The description goes on to say: " Precision made in Japan". The real Japanese Screw punch has the made in Japan embossed into the brass, the one I received had nothing anywhere that said Japan and it is definitely not a precision tool as it had a rough action when pressed down. And I never could get it to work properly. I contacted the seller and he said he'd refund my purchase in full, but upon receiving it he emailed me back that the package arrived ripped and empty.
Bought the paper to make garment and accessory patterns with and, while it's low priced for the size and quantity, the paper is very thin. I find it similar to butcher paper which I use for making moc-up patterns with, and I'll be using this for the same purpose. Purchased to make finished, sturdy patterns that will be used many times but it's not suitable for that. Thinner than typical printer paper.
stamps are cute and a good product but then the dies up in a matter of a few days and you have to go buy ink pads
Works great! Clean cuts! I am already looking to buy more different cutters. Great packing. Everything looked great! No complaints!
The needles are fine only because they were relatively inexpensive. But they are good only for general cotton fabrics. I tried them on denim and the needle bent out of shape. If it cannot work on denim, I wouldn't call it heavy duty really.
These are great tools for play doh. I was looking for something sturdy that my son wouldn't break. They have held up very well so far and he enjoys using them.
This yarn is soft but that is the best I can say about it. I crocheted a baby blanket with it and thought I would never get through the project. There were long sections of the yarn where the splitting and bunching up of fibers was so bad I felt like I was trying to manipulate clouds of cobwebs. I had to press on because there was no way of determining by sight or touch where the bad areas began and ended. If I could have known I would have cut the bad sections out. I had to re-do stitches two, three, even four or five times in spite of proceeding VERY slowly and with extreme care . On another web site there were many negative reviews of this yarn but there were good ones too and the few reviews on Amazon were favorable so I decided to go ahead and order. Big mistake. The tediousness and frustration of working with this yarn displaced the enjoyment of creating the blanket and this was a blanket for my first grandson so you gotta' figure things had to be pretty bad to crush the pleasure of making this blanket. Maybe the yarn works well for knitting. I threw the left over yarn in the trash and that's saying something considering what a penny pincher I am. I hope if I am some day compelled to make another baby item that there are other easier to work with soft yarns available
Plastic ends of hole punchers don't punch through 100# stock without three or four punches even at the strongest setting. Probably fine for lighter weight. "Trigger" gets out of alignment now and then and requires unscrewing the top and adjusting the works a bit, kind of like the innards of a ballpoint pen. If I had it to do over, I'd probably go with an old-fashioned hammer piece with a separate rivet setter, but I suppose if you like having the different sizes and don't use it over and over (as I do for a project that requires thousands of holes and rivets), it's a handy and inexpensive option.
This CD, though not her best (That being reserved, in my opinion, for Faster Than the Speed of Night), is still fantastic. Listen to her moving rendition of the Air Supply staple &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; and see if you can come out of it the same. I could not, and have never seen anyone listen to it without getting completely swept away by it. Also, &quot;You're the One&quot; is a fantastic tune. Bonnie Tyler's voice isn't for everyone, but then that is music. Not everyone likes the same thing, and God forbid if they did. Her voice is full of feeling and emotion, that raw smokiness that tugs at the heart and never lets go. Listen to her music with an open mind and with appreciation for its artist, who came back from throat surgery told she would never sing, and yet she had one of the most memorable songs not only of the last decade, but of all time. This album, more contemporary than most of hers, stands as a testament to Bonnie's versatility and ability to speak to all ages and musical eras. Listen and see if you don't become a Free Spirit yourself in the process.--Matthew Cason
I bought this as a first-time sewer to reupholster a couch. I taught myself to sew on this. It worked great and was easy to use. It has lots of different stitching options and is fairly intuitive.
This pin holder can maybe hold 20 pins before they start to fall off. I'm currently looking for something better.
While not perfect, this is the best glue gun I've ever used. Very easy to use with one hand. Would recommend to crafters.
I couldn't find a package of the Sarasa SE blue ballpoint pens in any stores (best I could find was where the blue was one pen in a 4-pack of 2 blacks and a red), but I was able to find a box on Amazon. Great price (12 for $20). Delivery was quick. Pens write very smoothly no matter what surface is underneath the paper. Love the feel. Rating is 4 stars instead of 5 only because it seems to me that the Sarasa SE's ink runs out a little sooner than other pens.
The stamps are a good size for toddler hands and the designs are very cute, however when the ink pad arrived it was dry. How disappointing to not even be able to use the stamps because we had no ink.As an update to this review... I contacted Melissa and Doug's customer service and they sent me a new ink pad same day - great service :)
I'm not what you would call a "serious" sewing person. I just wanted a machine that was easy to use so I could make a sun dress for my daughter, or a pillow case...you know, simply stuff. It worked fine for about a week. One day while sewing a skirt ruffle on, it jammed and the damage was worse than the machine cost. Thankfully it was still under warrenty. Singer just isn't what it used to be. They wouldn't even cover the cost of repairs. Thank you Amazon for being awesome.
I was so excited when I found this product at my local Hobby Lobby after finding it online in a google search for something else.. I bought it at the HL, which is about 30 minutes from me so it is quite a trip. I brought it home and my roommate spent over 30 minutes trying to figure the thing out. Once he actually managed to get the fabric on it for me, he handed it to me and it only took me about 30 seconds to figure out I absolutely HATED it. Like the other reviews its poor quality, shoddy ratchets, although the ratchet system would be awesome in a wooden product. It was easy to twist the whole thing and therefore loosening your work. I returned it the next day. I will never use one of these products again. I will stay with my traditional scroll rod frames. They work fantastic.I really hate having to give a bad review but the item is not worth the time to produce it... Honestly it doesn't even deserve a 1 rating but it wouldn't let me post without any rating. So there it is.. below 1, probably a -10 for me.
This machine is a nightmare, it is hard to use for my mother who is an experienced sewer and has been sewing since her 20's and sews very often. The machine is lacking in many simple thing such as the fact that the thread guide in step 4 doesn't stick out of the covering and so you have a hard time threading it, the needle threader instructions aren't clear and we still haven't figuredout how to use it, and the presser foot is just simply slid on rather than screwed tightly and so it often falls off if you move your hand over it while trying to thread the needle. This is so cheaply made and not at all user-friendly. It's a waste of $100. At least if you buy it at a proper store, you can try it out and have someone show you how to use it before you buy, by ordering online, you don't know what your getting nor have anyone to show you how to use it.
well, this is my first rock tumbler and i realize it isnt a professional model-i couldn't afford one. the problems i have with it are fairly simple and straight forward. the drum leaks quite alot, even if you follow the very limited instructions...i dont know about the final polishing stage, either. if you expect rocks that look like the ones you can buy at museums and such, you will be disappointed. i have heard that crushed walnut shells could do the trick, but of course they dont come with the kit. you only get one set of each-heavy grit, medium grit, and polish. you have to order refills(if you want to use the same brand, unless you are lucky enough to have a hobby shop that carry this brand) the prices do not seem to bad to me, but honestly i have yet to shop around much. it is a decent, but loud and messy product. good for a first time tumbler, i guess. good luck and happy tumblin'.
The paper which fills this "sketchbook" is not of a quality befitting the Moleskine reputation, being a plate-surfaced cardstock which looks suspiciously like cheap office-grade xerox paper, peculiarly resistant (because of sizing or some other coating) to ink washes -- not an inviting tableau upon which to work or draw. The design of the book itself, is, however, wonderful; I just wish that the Moleskine company would choose an interior paper that was actually designed for drawing and sketching; this is NOT. (Their regular blank notebook offers a better surface for drawing, though the paper is extremely lightweight.)
This little iron is does an ok job for what I was looking for - something small to press seams while sewing. It does fine for that, but certainly wouldn't work at getting out any kind of wrinkles.
These safety pins are tiny--barely 3/4" long. In the product dimensions they did not provide safety pin dimensions, but packaging dimensions.Moreover, by "assorted sizes" they must mean "two different sizes". Two tiny sizes of safety pins.Function was fine.Overall I give it 3 stars, for good function, but a lack of variety, and unexpected small size.
i recieved the product. pluged in and it burnt out. very disappointed. i will recommend buy this kinds of producyts from local stores only.
The sheets would not feed through my Lexmark inkjet printer. I ruined three sheets before giving up. I talked to someone who shipped me another package as per the guarantee but what good are they if my printer won't work?
This loom for children should have a selection of beads separated into colors (for easy use) and possibly larger beads. At least there should be a reference as to what beads to buy and where to buy them.
bought this brand of glue gun first because of the name and second because of the price, sadly the description of it being dripless was so false having owned different glue guns in the past for my business, it was time to replace, so i did some research and this model just stood out from the rest. could not believe the amount of glue it drips when just idle or warming up, unlike any other glue guns i have owned! sadly to say , because the brand name is so recognized for such great products, not this on!
I bought this sewing machine for my wife. Please understand this review is based solely on the expletives that spewed from my wife's mouth while sewing with this machine. Apparently bunching up, inadequate speed and difficulty threading the needle were some issues. I just remember my wife always using the stitch ripper to undo a tangled mess. However, the Singer Machine did one positive thing! It made me look like a super hero when I surprised my wife with a Pfaff Expressions 3.0. She dropped kicked the Singer and has never looked back! Seriously, if you are a novice sewer, try to save up for an intermediate machine. I realize it isn't fair to compare the Pfaff {a $1700 machine} with the Singer.
This product will only work on small stuff. If you've got normal sized scissors get another product.
This product does what it is intended to. Make sure to test the liquid on the surface of the object you are removing adhesive from, as faux leather, (for example), will have a bit of a white-ish residue after... May be true for other surfaces as well.
These are a step up for Crayola or Rose Art. The colors are bolder than these other brands. This is the brand the school art teacher recommends too.
For starters, all of Xyron's products come on two rolls that bind together when fed through the machine so when you feed it, your finished product is and will always be slightly curved. I used this machine with the double laminate, the sticker, and the magnet rolls and all of them have this result. The double laminate does a terrible job at sealing around even the flattest of paper and if you cut anywhere close to the edge-it WILL come apart so expect a few centimeters of dead space around your final project. It absolutely does not work if you use any types of layers- it will bubble and warp and not have a smooth lamination. I used this product for my homeschooling daily charts so they could be reused and easily wiped off. It is very thin plastic which stained easily even with a dry erase marker. I do not recommend using this product.
The handles are comfortable, and suitable for extended periods of work. I would recommend these punches for any crafter, but especially anyone who needs to punch a lot at one time.No complaints, great product!
I've been using my olfa cutter for years with the original blade and it still cuts like a razor. I cut leather, card board and mat board with out a hitch. great blade and great price compared to local retail outlets. I only bought this blade for a backup.
It's exactly what I wanted. The cutting mat is pliable, durable, and I have yet to see how long the grid printing will last which looks like it could hold up to a lot of abuse.I'm definitely please to get such a deal.
This was a long overdue purchase for me. I've been spoiled since my mom has always had industrial sewing machines and sergers. I've seen these "at home" machines in action before and have never been really impressed.I watched the sales videos and read the reviews of several models before choosing the CS6000i model. Of course, Amazon does an amazing job of getting products delivered VERY quickly so I made sure to grab extra accessories at the same time.For the price, it's unbeatable. It's super easy to use and looks to be pretty durable. I have only mended and altered a few garments (dresses, my son's shorts, etc) and have not sewn anything from scratch, but that's on my to do list next.Pros:CompactEasy to storeEasy to use and instructions are easy to understandComes with (almost) every accessory you needExtended shelf makes it easier to work withEasy to thread (once you figure it out - I watched a youtube video to help with this)Easy to change out the feetCons:Lots of instructions to read through (though as stated above, fairly easy to understand)The cover does not latch on, only 'covers' the machineSpool holder isn't tall enough for the larger spools of threadThe cons are things I can definitely live with.I also purchased an edger attachment so I wouldn't have to buy a serger quite yet.I'm quite excited about this purchase! My last trip to the alterations shop cost me $75 (roughly half of what this machine cost), so I see lots of savings in my future=)
I've had this mat for about two months and its cutting performance is great and it certainly works as advertised. However, the mat material has a VERY strong odor that smells exactly like a skunk. When I first received the mat, I put it in my office and within just a few minutes the smell was unbearable. I quickly moved it to a remote cabinet in my shop which I now try not to open unless I really need to. I'm trying to find a large plastic storage bag to hopefully seal in the smell, but no luck yet. The smell has not diminished one bit over the two months I have had it, so if you buy this otherwise great mat, be prepared ...
The product description is not accurate. It indicates that the set contains two pairs of the scissors and a Fuzz remover. The package arrived with only one pair of scissors and no fuzz remover. Beware of the false advertising.
The wrong ribbon is posted with this ribbon. This is actually an orange ribbon with blue dots NOT the rainbow ribbon pictured. I ordered expecting what is pictured and had a deadline to meet and it messed everything up. We aware that you are not ordering what is pictured here!!!!
I am disappointed in these gingher embroidery scissors. I have another pair of gingher embroidery scissors that I purchased MANY years ago that are still excellent. The ones I just purchased are much too stiff, and we were unable to loosen them. In addition, they started squeaking. We oiled them; the squeaking stopped but then returned
Awesome deal to have this paper delivered to your house (love Amazon Prime). We use this paper for wrapping paper, table clothes, craft paper and packing material. It is high quality thick paper. Just make sure you have room for the roll it's big!
Never arrived...hard to communicate with seller..they wanted me to remind them to look into the fact my product never arrived as they were on vacation and I had to wait till they got back...never buy from this person again!!Really wanted these crystals for a project I was working on!!
Awesom Product but on they other they really need to up the cds so that you can created your own designs rather than keep spend more money i find disapointing that i now have to find the up to 8.03 verson cds.
This hole punch has solid construction and does a good job. I am glad we picked this up. Good value.
I am not unsatisfied with the product, but unhappy withthe price. I later found the same light box almost 30$ less.
Purchased this hoping to use it for punching chip board. Worked for the first three punches and then broke. Don't bother if you want something with some heft.
this is not what I expected, I wanted a shorter reel as far as height goes, it is hard to store and heavy, I hardly use the stuff I wanted the paer to be not so tall.
My daughter bought this toy with money she saved, used up all the parts in less than an hour, and we were disappointed to find NO information on how to get replacement pieces to keep making stickers. This is a major problem with this toy.
This machine was a piece of junk and truly a waste of my money, time and patience trying to get it to work. Very flimsy, not easy to use. I was very disappointed since this was suppose to be for a 5 year old. Would not recommend unless you are a seamstress and already know how to work a sewing machine.
After having good experiences with Melissa and Doug products I was extremely disappointed in this stamp set. The ink was dry and unusable, the pencils didn't write and the box itself does not have a cover for storing. My grand daughter had no fun at all with this set. Worthless, useless product.
I purchased one of these for my wife. When we unpacked it, we found the needle was not aligned to go into the slot on the base plate. Instead it would hit the plate itself. A call to Singer's support line confirmed that this is something that requires service and cannot be fixed by us. However, authorized dealers won't touch machines like this unless they sold it, or unless they have an arrangement to get paid by Singer for warranty work. So, we returned the machine for a replacement. Amazon was very good about getting the replacement sent to us, but the replacement had the same problem! Appears to be poor quality control at the Singer factory. We returned the second machine for a refund.
helps with machine to make taking out the stickers easier and helps with placement of stickers etc.
Recently I purchased the Brother CS6000i sewing machine to take to quilting classes. I needed a light weight portable machine and this machine fit the bill. It does everything my regular machine does and is very good. It is very light and easy to carry. I was very pleased with my first use and very glad I purchased this machine. For the price it is wonderful. Don't be afraid to buy a Brother. Great quality.
These earrings were as advertized, Tiny Sterling silver, turquoise and lapis inlay. If I had seen in person how tiny they were I might not have bought them and looked for some a bit larger, but they are well made and my favorite gemstones. And the price was great. They are comfortable and of quality materials.
Not to shabby of a fabric shaver. As one other reviewer noted you need to slip off the cover and depth adjustable cap...it simply does not work with it in place.You also need to give the batteries a good 6 hours to charge. The shaver doesn't work with the power cord attached...that's only for charging the batteries.
i ordered these to finish a blanket for my 10 year old... the texture is amazing but darn to darn the colors weren't exact.. some were faded & others were bright.. also I only ordered once and got 2 shippments and billed twice... so watch your payment account,.. I got the blanket done and my kiddo loves it..
Great item! I plan on purchasing a few more. If your thinking about getting one for yourself or as a gift, stop thinking about it; I assure you it's money well spent. It's top class; from the weight, the action and the quality of impression, everything about it says first rate. Also, don't be timid about requestIng a unique design, the company's staff are creative people who in my experience can bring your ideas to pass. Great item!
I don't learn from reading. I learn from being taught in real life, by a real person. Well this book taught me. This book is definitely for anyone who is just like me. It is amazing and i cannot believe it but i'm tatting. I picked it up and did it like i always just knew how and could. I will post some images from all i've done in about 3 days of having this book. I'm hooked and i would have payed upward of $50 for this book. Amazing. I'll be using tatting in jewelry making, crazy quilting and much more.
Okay, so I didn't read the actual blurb, but I wanted a book about ART journals, not about making journals. But, if you are looking for good ideas for cute journals ... this is it. Lovely art work and clear instructions.
This is a great price for a large set of knitting needles although I do wish I had ordered the 24" set because 36" is too big for most projects but that was my mistake as a novice knitter. Overall it's a great price and good quality, just make sure to get the best size for you.
For $[...] I expected much better quality. The thing fell apart after just over a year.
Yes. I am impressed with the product. It worked fine. Price V/S work performed by tool is excellent. you don't need to spend $15/$20 for pricey tool which work just like this Hole Punch.
Product is so so. Did not work on my jacket. The stops don't work very good at all. Instructions are horrible. Hopefully I can find something it will work on in the future. Wish I would have taken my jacket into the local alterations shop to fix zipper, gonna have to do it anyways. Maybe I did something wrong, but then that goes back to the horrible instructions.
Unlike the old cases where the machine snugly fits inside and the lid over it, This is an inexpensive piece of plastic with latches on the sides. The machine just sits on a plastic grid bottom with nothing to cradle or hold it in, so it can bounce around inside when walking or if tipped over. As for walking with it, the handle in strangely and cheaply made. There are ridges for grips, but they don't work well since they are raised ridges which dent your fingers when you hold it, due to the weight of the machine. If you're moving it in a short distance (across a room) then you're not holding it long enough to hurt your fingers. Hmm, can't find much good about it, except it is a good dust cover. Why would Singer make such nice machines and skimp on the carrying case? It is the type of quality that would be given away at no charge, with the purchase of a machine.
My experience would've been perfect except for the fact that the handle had jagged plastic leftover from the molding process and it cut my hands the first time I had to use it. I filed down the problem areas and it's fine now. there should be a little more care given to the product before it's sold to the public.
This the first sewing machine I've personally owned. I grew up using my mom's Singer machine, so I knew I wanted to look at Singers before thinking about any other brands. I fell in love with the splash of red on this machine, and the fact that it includes all of the basic necessary features. Two pleasant surprises - 1. The thread cutter located to the left of the needle/presser foot. Definitely comes in handy! 2. The brush included in this set has a cap on one end covering a seam ripper. Very insightful.
My 23 month old daughter received this chair as an early birthday gift. She LOVES to have her very own chair that she can sit in and rock and prop her feet up just like mommy. Its large enough she has plenty of space to lounge and relax or sit Indian style if she wants, and its light enough that she can move it where she wants it (depending on if she wants to read or watch cartoons). The Ottoman is strong enough for her to sit on and roll all over. Very well constructed. No marks or issues with the wood portion and the Upholstered section is flawless. If my daughter isn't in it I usually see one of my cats sitting it it LOL. I highly recommend for toddlers, especially if they are in a MINE phase.
I was looking to buy another PB207 so I came to Amazon, as I bought mine about ten years ago from an online welding supply house. To be honest I was amazed at the poor reviews. The quality of the product must have went south as I use this lighter on a regular basis with no issues. Once in a blue moon I need to click it twice to light. Overall it has been very reliable for lighting cigars indoors and now all most always outdoors or in my truck. I use Savinelli butane all of the time as it is has been my "go to" fuel for over 20 years. I smoke a pipe and use a Savinelli "Old Boy" with an angled flame. I do not sell lighters or do I have anything to gain by my positive comments other than expressing my good luck with this lighter. I guess the only thing I do is always make sure it is full of fuel I have never let it get less than half full. I have the clear model with no child safety feature.
This roller (brayer) works fine but I had to lubricate the axle to quiet the squeak it was making. It's not the best quality, but it works fine for firmly affixing paper to my electronic cutters mat.
Exactly what I wanted, 6 pack came in fine... Note the depth - the picture is a bit misleading, they are only 1&#34; deep.
The item was very similar to pandora and very cheap, too. It's very good for someone who's on a budget but wants the look of a pandora.
My daughter bought this yarn to start a knitting project. It is nice yarn, but it is a tiny skein and it had a LARGE price tag.Check prices elsewhere to avoid getting RIPPED off.
Not much you can say about construction paper. This is a good thickness and works great for the things my 7 year old needs construction paper for. As another reviewer said, it's not a dark black, but a dark greyish black. But was happy to find the longer size since even the crafts stores out here didn't have any in this size.Shipped quickly.
My husband just recently bought me this machine and I love it sooooooo much! It really boosted my sewing motivation. It runs so smoothly, winding the bobbin is like a breeze, the instruction manual is easy to understand, love the button hole maker, and how it can sew on buttons for u, another thing I love about this machine is that when you're sewing the needle automatically stays down when you stop sewing, i think that is very convenient. This machine has lots and loads of great features, I love all the stitches, it comes with a nice amount of accessories, sews great and smoothly through layers of fleece, etc. I highly recommend this machine to anyone!
Fiance was gonna use this for her shirt after our wedding. After the transfer, quite a few of the stones didn't stay and had to be glued on with fabric glue. She got a little glue on the shirt, tried to scratch it off, and made a small hole in the shirt. The shirt ended up in the trash. Wasn't a good day for the already stressed soon to be bride. Anyway, be prepared to glue some of the stones on if you buy this. At least it was relatively cheap...
Three stars is enough.The Good - On first inspection, these easels look good, not great simply good. They are light weight, I'm hoping the claim to support 25# of weight is true (which is why I chose this easel over others). The 2 slides that support the weight are 2.5in so your frame can be about 2.25" wide. They snap down and stay put with tension, which I expect will loosen in time--hope it withstand at lease a year of readjustment, but by the looks of things, I doubt they will . They are light weight which is real nice.The Bad - the tightening mechanism that holds the height of the 3 telescoping legs is cheap. I couldn't tell if I was tightening or loosening or anything for that matter, there is very little movement that can be felt. When I looked closely I noticed a double sided arrow indicating it's what tightens/loosens and holds the legs in place. Again, it looks real cheap and I know that in time I'll need to find a way to keep the legs from sliding (I don't trust they'll support the 25lbs so I'm packing a roll of electrical tape just in case).I chose this easel over the others because of the claim to support 25lbs and the price. The $46 price is a bit much, I would have liked a carrying case. In a couple of months I'll update my review.The best part of ordering these easels is that I placed the order on Saturday, they were to be delivered via Amazon Prime by Wednesday, I received them today Monday around 4pm. AWESOME!
Have used the denim patches earlier (different brand though) which worked fine and expected the same but this one peeled off just after the first week of use. Not satisfied with the product.
I've wanted to learn how to make a photo quilt for some time and I think this will give me the information I need to get started. Now I just need the time!The photos are great, drawings are concise and informative, and there isn't too much information to overwhelm the reader. Get it if you have any interest in making one of these. Get it if you just want a fantastic book with great ideas. Get it if you have a quilting friend you want to give a terrific present to.
There is potential in this machine. Lots of stitches, comes with a variety of presser feet. But this thing has given me so much heartache, ruined so many projects and caused me to have to get out the seam ripper AGAIN (the most valuable thing that came in the box) to rip out a big gnarled mess of thread from my fabric. I sew as a hobby, making clothes for my kids and crafting projects. This machine makes everything a lot harder than it needs to be.It has terrible tension issues that can't seem to be fixed by adjusting the tension. Sometimes it is so awful that my stitches appear to be diagonal rather than straight, and my fabric gathers without my wanting it to. I have to take everything apart, put it back together. Try a variety of tension settings. Curse. Rip everything out. Start again.You can pretty well guarantee that if you try to feed more than two layers of quilting weight cotton through this thing it will jam up and just continually sew in one spot. Prepare to have to yank your project through the feed dogs from behind the presser foot or you will get nowhere.To my annoyance, I have to be constantly vigilant over how my fabric is fed through, because it seems to want to feed it all at and angle or a curve instead of straight, so my lines of stitches end up looking wavy and messy. And unless I put a million pins in and hold the bottom edge of my fabric tightly together, it will separate the different fabric layers noticeably by the end of my seam.Good luck sewing on knits. I hand it to Brother for including some stitches that should work really well on stretch fabrics. The problem is that with the bad feed system, and the tension issues, everything looks really bad.For the price, you would be better off finding something stronger on craigslist.
I wondered if this would be broken in the shipping and it was. I haven't used it yet but I imagine it will work just fine. Probably shouldn't order chalk of any kind through the mail.
I bought this to cut fabric for quilting but it didn't work out so well. I bought a cutting mat and everything, but I still had to press really hard to cut the fabric and it made it hard to cut accurately. I went back to scissors for cutting fabric. I started using it for cutting paper for scrapbooking and stuff and it works well for that! I guess I'll try a better brand like Olfa or a higher end Fiskars for fabric.
If you're looking for the old fashioned, scrapbook look, look elsewhere.This looks like black duct tape across the corner of your photo.You may like it. We did not.
My granddaughters love to do arts and crafts and these scissors were just perfect for them to make all kinds of creations.
I made two fleece hats with this. Then I recenly started sewing a dress out of cotton and had all kinds of trouble. This is a poorly built serger. The presser foot broke and the design is inferior in the way it operates. could not be fixed by reputable sewing machine store. I had to manually operate the presser foot. Then it jammed and would not sew at all. took it back to the store and they tell me it is a tension error and must be sent out and will probably cost $150 to repair. I paid $199 to purchase it, so putting another $150 into it is ridiculous. I apparently bought a lemon. Very disappointed. I would suggest you purchase another serger and research it very carefully. get one with a better warranty. I wasted my money.
I purchased this machine as a starter for my nieces who had never used one before. I didn't want to invest a lot of money until I knew if they would stick with it. This machine has served its purposes well. It was easy to understand the manual and has plenty of features for a beginner. I'm now considering buying another so each can have their own.
1 give this mat 3 out of 5 stars ... Though other mats claim to have a 1" grid, they often come with smaller increments as well; this mat does not. The photo did not provide a close-up close enough for my proper examination. The mat arrived in a giant box which I was thrilled about, but the mat was probably damaged before or while placing it into the box. I am keeping the mat only because I want to protect my glass top desk from crafting (I don't care if it gets stained). I will also be using this mat to convert my wood mounted rubber stamps to a cling mount system, so I don't want my glass desk getting cut or scratched either with a rotary blade, craft knife nor a hot knife. I will upload a photo of the damaged mat. It appears to be minor damage, but when you pay full price for something, you expected it to be undamaged. The odor is not that bad and should dissipate in several days. In a few months or so, I will be updating my review to reflect it's performance.
I taught myself how to sew with this sewing machine. The manual has simple instructions yet it's comprehensive and easy to understand. The demonstration video is extremely helpful especially for those who learn better by looking than by reading a manual. I think this sewing machine is superb value for money.
I love Debbie Bliss's books! Her knits for babies are so beautiful! However, I am having the hardest time finding the exact Cashmerino Aran yarns she says to use for the Garter Stitch Blanket on page 58. She references the yarns using their color name BUT all of the Debbie Bliss yarn suppliers reference her yarns by numbers NOT color names. Some suppliers do not even sell all of her yarns. Talk about frustrating! I searched today for over an hour in a local yarn store, with the yarn store clerk, for the correct colors for this blanket and we just couldn't find them. Debbie Bliss does NOT even use color names for the Cashmerino Aran yarns on her Web site - only numbers. I am very frustrating but determined. I give the beautiful knit designs in her book FIVE STARS but I give the materials list ONE STAR - THREE STARS total if you average the two. Debbie Bliss you need to write your books from the perspective of your reader - we want to knit your projects not just admire their beautiful appearance.
I realize that this "should" be a review about the quality of the product, BUT for almost 2 YEARS people have been commenting that they received one canvas instead of a pack of six. Sorry, but that is simply unacceptable. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for letting it go on this long. I'm sorry that the manufacturer won't have people purchasing their item, but there is no excuse for a problem to continue for nearly 2 years and not be resolved.
This is an average machine, the threading is not "lay-in", but neither is it imposssible. Need to be sure to change to cone type thread for good thread feed, and to thread by "the number". Finished stitch is adequate and will serve for finishing seams.
I have used these pens for fifteen years, which tells you something right there. They do not have the durability of a refillable pen set, but I find the disposability a convenience. If something happens to them, I don't have to feel bad, and I never have to refill them.Their primary good feature is the ink, which is very dark, covers well, does not bleed through paper, and is waterproof and archival-quality . . . for real. It is an extremely high-quality ink, and that's why I keep buying them. I have found no better disposable pen in fifteen years.The ink flow is moderate, neither too slow nor too free. They are well-suited for both outlining and for a more scratchy cross-hatching/scumbling approach, as they aren't so free-flowing that ink will wick out of them at the slightest touch of pen to paper. Put the tip down, leave it, that's about the size of the dot you get.The ink dries quickly and does not easily smear, although on very smooth paper that absorbs slower, execute care. As they run out of ink, they flow less easily, which can be frustrating.I draw in spurts, off and on, and have found that, unused, the pens will reliably last about a year if carefully stored (i.e., make sure the cap is on, it's not hot in the room, etc.). When using several sizes at once, cap them between use. The ink dries quickly on paper, which is great, but it also dries quickly in the tips. You can get them going again by writing a bit, but it's better to just take care.They write and draw well on most regular drawing papers, but not so well on photo papers or papers with any sort of plastic or super-slick finish; for those jobs, there are Micron pens specifically for photo paper. They aren't Sharpies, and don't write on things besides paper.The pen tips are not metal, but they are hard; they give a consistent line, and while there is some give, you will not get a terribly sensitive line out of them, and trying to do so will result in either bent nibs or metal nib housings (this can be a problem if you have a heavy hand, especially with the smaller sizes) or pen tips that are "soft" and will not draw as tight a line as before, or possibly tips that split.Overall, good pens, and would be especially good for a young artist experimenting with pen and ink.
This table was a christmas gift in 2010. Here we are almost a year later, and this table has held up fairly well. However, I'm currently in the market for a new one...I'll start with the pros first.Pros:- Durable. My son just turned 3 when we gave this to him and since then he has really put this table through its paces. Toys have been banged on it, crayons and pens have made their mark, and I can't tell you how many times the table and chairs have been dragged around the house by my budding little home redecorator. My husband and I have even sat in the chairs with him on occasion and were surprised at how well they held us up given our weight compared to his.- I loved the idea of the different colored bins underneath. Originally we were sent only red and blue bins...BORING!! When I read the description, it said this table came with one red, blue, yellow, and green bin so I was kinda disappointed. I called Kidkraft (a bit anal...I know) and asked how I could get a yellow and green bin sent to me. The extra bins were sent my way free of charge. With all the small toys he had laying around the house I thought this was a great way to get things organized.- Size/Design. This table is perfect for kids ages 2-5. The backs on the chairs are high enough to comfortably support small children and the overall design of this set is just cute.The reason I am looking for new table and chair set at this point is this whole allan wrench assembly. This may be better explained through the cons...Cons:- Assembly!! This table took forever to assemble. We ran into problems when we realized that not all the pre-cut holes were aligned correctly. A few were about 2-3 millimeters off which doesn't seem like much but it made trying to fit the darn screws through the holes a pain in the butt!! Be prepared to argue with your spouse (should he/she help) for no reason at all other than frustration...- Constantly having to re-tighten screws that have come loose with an allen wrench that nobody can find!!- There are 4 weird looking screws? that go underneath the table to help bolt it down to the legs. It doesn't matter how many times we tighten it...they are forever falling out. So much so that my husband had to put two L brackets underneath instead to keep the table from coming off the legs when leaning against one end of the table.- The bins that come with this table broke with a few months. While cheap, I was expecting them to hold up a bit longer then they did. My child is also rough with toys so it was probably his fault versus kidkraft's quality.While this is a nice table to look at, I am just sick and tired of tightening screws. I shouldn't have to be concerned about my child's safety, however at this point I am. I have come in his room many times to find him playing with loose screws that came from his chair. I am surprised he hasn't collasped while sitting in one yet. I personally wouldn't recommend this table and am hoping my new search will result in a table that has done away with allen wrenches because I have yet to find a piece of furniture that has any longevity when allen wrench assembly is used.
It's a fantastic buy and it works wonderfully....I would recommend this item to anyone and you can't beat the price.
I purchased this machine to use while visiting my daughter in another state. I used the machine to make a shirt with buttons and an apron out of canvas. I was quite impressed with the quality of the stitches for such an inexpensive machine. It did a great job sewing through multiple layers of canvas and the button holes were perfect! Then, before packing it up, I decided to check out the bobbin case and clean up any lint. It was nearly impossible to remove the plate over the bobbin. The plate is in two parts, one is plastic. I have to admit, that I did not look in the Owner's Manual, but figured removing the plate is a no brainer. (I have used dozens of machines over the years and have been sewing for over 40 years!) Eventually I was able to remove the plates and reassemble everything. I am concerned that routine maintenance on this machine will be a problem. Only time will tell!!
I bought this machine on AMAZON in 2008 - I think it was a refurb. It worked fine for awhile but then it consistently started the stitch skipping problem other reviews mentioned. Now it cannot even make a straight seam with out the thread either breaking on getting all wacked out in the bobbin.I have cleaned this machine, adjusted the tension, gave it a new needle etc. After spending 3 hours in frustration trying to hem a pair of jeans, I gave up. I called a local sewing machine repair shop and was told, "don't waste your money."I have since bought a used, older Singer.Do not buy this machine unless you enjoy fighting with it!
I am new to sewing & bought these scissors based on the reviews & boy are they great! They cut the fabric so easily & never get stuck or caught. These are by far my favorite pair!
I purchased this Brother Brand ruffler because I wanted a good quality ruffler for my machine. But I was disappointed with the entire order.First, it arrived an entire week late. I own a sewing business and was depending on receiving this by the date I was given from the Seller.Second, when I finally got it I was disappointed when it didn't fit on my Brother machine. I thought a Brother ruffler was supposed to fit on a Brother machine?! I've used rufflers before and know how to attach them and use them so this was disappointing, to say the least. I would've appreciated a list of machines this ruffler foot doesn't work on from the seller BEFORE I purchased it. I don't know the quality of the ruffler because I never had the chance to use it.Third, when I called the seller to return the item, they were very rude. While in the middle of asking a question, they hung up on me. They said the only way they would return it is if I paid the return shipping AND they would deduct additional shipping off my return. The total shipping cost I paid was $1.43. The Seller took an additional $6 off my return which was MUCH more than the actual shipping cost. I will never buy from this seller again.I hate writing negative reviews, but this seller definitely deserves it for their customer service. Please be cautious before you purchase this item and be sure to find out whether or not the ruffler will fit your machine. I have learned that I will only purchase items sold by amazon.com - I can trust them and they have incredible customer service.
Received my Brother PED-Basic within 10 business days.. I haven't tested the hardware yet but I have loaded the software.
We painted two times, full colored belly, and still lots of paint left.pros: it said FDA approved, but who knows :)easy to remove, easy to cleanpretty efficient, vivid colorcons: package looks cheapsince it's easy to remove, it also means sensitive to water, if you want multiple layers, be careful, the color can be mixedno grey color, no earth color, hard to mix to get an idea color if you don't want to use these basic colors
We did not use the easel often yet, but we were able to assemble it within a few minutes and it seems to be a very stable product which can hold canvas which is not too big. While not in use it can be set aside not taking too much spaceWhat we did not realize by reading the description is that the easel was mainly made for people sitting on a high chair in front of it. If the center guide rail would have been made slightly longer, then that would have also allowed the canvas to be set high enough to stand while painting
It is not as strong as I thought, But I am getting to FAT also
This product is great. It was however probably too small for my needs. I do 15.5 gallon batches to fill kegs and this is probably the right size for a 5-10 gallon. But it still works and is made well. Also the product came very quick without any problems.
Needed construction paper for a big move that we were helping a client with, and this paper had great colors and the paper stood up to multiple moves.
This is a really good album. I only gave it 4 stars simply because it was just not something spectacular. It is well-made and does the job for a small album.
I bought this machine hoping to be able to make some clothes and do some repairs and save some money. I know how to sew and have used several old machines over the years. I thought a new one would be an improvement. Unfortunately it has never worked well enough to be usable and was a total waste of money. The bobbin set up is the problem. The bobbin pops out and is hard to put in right, the needle goes down and gets its thread all wadded up in the bobbin so that you have to take the bobbin out and cut the tangled thread to get the material loose. I took it to a sewing machine shop to have them look at it, and tell me if there was something I was doing wrong, and they said it worked. I took it back home and tried it once and it was even worse, without changing anything from how they had it.Even if there is some trick someone knows to make it work, it isn't worth the trouble.
I needed some stuff sewn by machine and having it done by someone else would be too expensive. I asked my wife and she told me that she didn't have the skill level required. So, I bought this machine, followed the directions in the printed manual and now I'm sewing all kinds of fabric together. (Some of it is even usable when I'm done.) For a first machine this is wonderful. It won't do thick multiple layers (I've done 4 layers of fleece, but it didn't like it.) and I wouldn't try leather unless it was really thin, but it will do the basics and then some.Cautions: Use good thread or you will have problems with your thread breaking or tangling on the bottom. Don't sew too fast for the fabric you are working on or your thread will break. (Fleece requires a medium speed at the most.) Don't try to start too close the the edge of your fabric or the feet won't feed. (At least with fleece.)Tip: When sewing fleece use masking tape to stabilize the fabric and keep it from stretching and bunching. Just don't sew through the tape; sew next to it. After testing several stitches I've been using the triple stitch (02) at the lowest settings for fleece with good results. (Yes, I've been sewing a lot of fleece. It's one of the major reasons I bought the machine.)
Really thought I was going to get a good thing, especially for attaching my suspender buttons. What a piece of junk. So far using a entire pack of clips I managed 4 buttons and not sure how long they will remain attached. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH. You can actually attach a button faster doing it the tried and true way -- needle and thread.. I give it one star and that is a stretch.
I had two types of projects, a digital photo album and some trifold flyers for my business. I tried two types of double-sided paper for my inkjet printer. This paper gave a faint yellow tinge to my photos, and is too thick for my flyers. For both uses, printworks photo project paper looks better. The latter is a bit shinier than the epson, which might be a downside for some projects.
I purchased this machine just over a year and a half ago for my wife. She's used it for small sewing tasks intermittently since then, but probably hasn't used the machine more than 20 hours in that time. It worked well and met her sewing needs for a while, but one day a couple months ago it started frequently jamming and the bobbin thread pickup started to become unreliable. We talked to a local repair shop about it and they said it would probably cost around $100 to diagnose and repair the problem. Singer has a warranty, but it only covers many parts for 1 year and it doesn't cover labor cost of repairs.So, unwillingly to spend almost half the cost of the machine on repair I set out to repair it myself and found the timing of the machine was way off. We couldn't figure out how this could have happened since the machine once worked, but adjusting the timing so the shuttle hook would once again arrive at the needle at the right time fixed the issues.I'm giving the machine a 3 because with the timing adjusted it's been working well again, but I'm concerned that the machine may break down again and require frequently repair (which is either time consuming or expensive depending on whether you are willing and able to do the work yourself).
They send me the sewing machine with damages and NEVER respond.
Had to send it to the factory after 2 weeks. Blade slips off. Retailer had same problem with the one they had.
I tried out the product and the overall quality is average compared to HP ink and paper.
The paint looks great, until it dries. It chips and looks horrible. It takes forever to apply as well because the paint doesn't want to stay on the skin. I tried painting a pumpkin for halloween. After 4 hours of painting, it looked great, until it dried and began flaking...
My grandgals don't play with it.There is nothing to do but dot-dot-dot.I thought it would be a little something different but itdid not go over.
Excellent quality for any art project. Perfect thickness. I use it to cover the table during a class so the kids can doodle, color off the page, or have oopses and its not a prob. About to start 2 year old finger painting on this. Confident it is perfect.
first time I used it the strainer bag ripped in the corner. after I figured out the tincle strength I haven't ripped another, however I will probably double bag next time.
I had one of these for about 8 years. It worked when I needed it to work and did what I asked of it. I only ever used the straight stitch, zig-zag and hem stitch functions. I only sewed on knit fabric once, with everything else being woven fabric. I made curtains and dresses and simple baby quilts. The tension occasionally needed re-adjusting after replacing the bobbin, and once the needle jammed and broke, but I imagine these things sometimes happen with many machines. I even full-on dropped it on a concrete floor once from a height of about 4 feet and, after a trip to the local sewing machine repair store for some TLC, it was good as new and continued working for another 5 years. I have no complaints. I'd still be using it now, if a flood hadn't rusted the insides stuck.
I am so happy to have this new machine. My old one did not have nearly the functions that this one has. It runs very smoothly and quietly. This machine is top notch and a bargain at the price. The many different stitches are very nice, but my favorite is the automatic button hole function! It sews beautifully and would be great for any seamstress to use.
I have had my machine for a little over 3 years and it has had numerous problems. It is very difficult to thread. My bobbin casing is always catching the thread and coming out. I have had to fix it many times. Sometimes the machine just doesn't sew right and I have to turn it off for a while and later it is just fine??? It is a very inconsistant machine that has little to no direction from the manual on the problems I encountered. I would spend a little extra and get a better machine.
The pockets that come with this case are nice. It has a deep pocket on one of the sides that really comes in handy. I have another bag similar to this one made by Darice. I wasn't familiar with the Darice brand, but had a number of items from BeadSmith, so I thought that the higher price (+$20) I was paying for the BeadSmith bag meant that I was going to be a superior product. Not necessarily the case when compared side-by-side.#1: The nylon material feels cheap and thin. Compared to the Darice material, the BeadSmith material is much thinner. The needle used made a number of visible holes along the stitching through the cheaper material. Also, the front pocket while zippered, is half the size of the Darice's front pocket which is only secured by the lid's velcro. The carrying strap is minimal at best. There is no pad and depending on how heavy your bag is and how much you have to carrying it, you may end up replacing it so it doesn't dig into you. The Darice bag has the same type of strap, but given the higher price for the BeadSmith bag, shouldn't the strap at least be better?#2: The zipper-system is a little odd. However, it appears to be a common approach as the Darice bag uses the same zipper-system. You can zip the drop-down access panel on both sides, but not along the top. You can zip the top access panel on both sides, but again, not along the same area as the drop-down access panel. BeadSmith instead chooses to rely on velcro to secure this area of the bag. That is fine and dandy - IF - you use the carrying strap and not just the handle. You may get a rude surprise when you pick this bag up by only the top handle and your plastic cases with their contents come tumbling out of your carrying case. The BeadSmith carrying handle does seem to have more support built around it compared to Darice's carrying handle; however, if your plastic cases are heavy - as mine are - using the carrying strap is really the most secure option.#3: The plastic cases included are nice. I am a little concerned that the latches that secure these cases will eventually succumb to continual use, but they do seem to close and stay closed. You get five plastic cases with this bag, but no flocked bead board like some of Darice's models. The plastic cases have four fixed compartments that measure: W: a little over 1.5", L: 6", D: 1.5". One of those long compartments is smaller due to a indention to allow a user to carry the case. There is also a large adjustable compartment that measures: W: 4.5", a little over 6.5", D: 1.5". Each of the plastic cases come with three dividers that can be broken up to make smaller compartments by dividing the large adjustable compartment as well as the four long fixed compartments. I like the longer compartments for my pre-strung beads to lay so they don't rub against each other as much as in a smaller compartment; however, they are a little too narrow to hold much volume for some of my medium to large beads. The Darice plastic cases are not adjustable for any of the compartments. For the Darice plastic cases, there is one large compartment that measures W: 1.75", a little over L: 4.5", D: 1.75". The remaining sixteen measure almost W: 1.75", almost L: 2.5", D: 1.75".If you are needing a black carrying bag with plastic carrying cases, this may be the bag for you. I ended up returning this bag because my Darice bag is the one I prefer toting around.
I received this as a gift from my mom so naturally I want to keep it as long as I can and use it, if only for sentimental reasons. I hate this sewing machine. It let me complete one project, a rectangular dog bed, perfectly. After that one project it started jamming and bunching the thread on the bottom of the fabric. I took everything back to square one, oiled it, followed all of the instructions and still cannot get it to work. Put it back in the closet, let my anger and frustration cool off for awhile, took it back out, started all over - same result, jamming machine and thread bunching. The Singer site advice is to never turn the wheel clockwise and if you have turned it clockwise, the machine needs to be repaired.So, they set the machine up to be broken so that they can charge almost as much as you paid for it to repair it.I'm going to keep it in the closet until I can let go of the sentimental attachment, meantime I'm getting a Brother machine.
I bought this cutter for use in bookbinding and papermaking projects. It cuts paper, even up to 240 gsm quickly and precisely. Using this cutter, a large framing square, and a sheet of plywood gives nearly the same results as a regular paper cutter, but provides more flexibility. I cannot comment on the durability of the blade, but if it is like other Fiskar products, I am sure I will be pleased.
I bought this sewing machine,because I needed something to replace a very accent Singer Machine that I have. It worked well for 5mons and then I was sewing and the needle just fell down and broke. The machine isnt all metal that I found out. The piece that makes it sew is plastic and broke off. I went to go get it serviced and to have it fixed costs more than the machine is worth.Don't waste your money,buy something with all metal parts and dont waste your time on this junk. The warranty is pointless in this case.
If it keeps the pigeons off me in St. Mark's Square, it was a worthwhile investment.
I dont know if you are supposed to get both sets in the order but we only got one. Our daughter likes them anyway, they are great for a decoration.
I am not a scrapbooker. I purchased this book to hold 12x12 inch art prints that I wanted to display. It works extremely well for that purpose given it's default dimensions. The quality of the album is very good and better than I expected. Each of the sheets has thick gauge plastic with double-sided inserts to hold whatever you put inside (art prints in my application). The exterior is very nice, and would be suitable for a custom photo album for a wedding or other event. This album was much cheaper than those available at local arts/crafts stores. Honestly, it seems the popularity of scrapbooking as a hobby has caused exaggerated pricing to become rampant from the $30+ priced albums I found locally. Thankfully, this one is much cheaper and ships free. Recommended for display art prints. I can't speak for it's usefulness for scrapbookers since I bought it for a different purpose.
okay. I bought this because I saw that the reviews for it was pretty good. but the thread usually get caught in the mechanism and there usually is a bobbin problem. It's not all that light neither. The foot pedal is the worst. The foot pedal is not sensitive to different pressures so it is really difficult to find a medium or a very slow speed to a beginner. did i also mention how loud it was? It doesn't even seem computerized. Just invest in one of their better sewing machines.
This is the second Buttoneer that I've owned. It works better than the first one I bought, but still has problems. The plastic fasteners have a tendency to break when being inserted. This device breaks about one in four of them, which is kind of frustrating. Since the two buttoneers are identical for all I can see, one could expect that performance of another would be somewhere between these two. The fasteners don't last as long as I would hope. I haven't kept records, so I couldn't tell you how long.
I guess you get what you pay for. The machine does not do well with heavier fabrics, such as denim as advertised.The machine is so light weight that it moves as fabric is moved. The stitching quality is NOT there.
I like the idea of this product, but I think it was built very poorly. The plastic that holds it together is flimsy and sad. I'm afraid I may one day break it by simply opening the product. My spindle of thread also fall right out of it as soon as I open it.I someone invents a better put together product. Get research & design at this fast!
I have a sister in law who takes painting classes and this was her xmas present. She said the paint is great quality and couldnt believe how cheap it was, she usually pays $6-7 each paint.
The category is Jacquard Activators and Agents. The product is just the 5lbs of Soda Ash, which is necessary for dying and works fine. This title and total lack of description are entirely misleading.
I thought fiskars would make great preschool scissors for my kids... WRONG... hated these wish I hadn't bought them. My daughter is 3YO and can use them with one hand she needs to physically use her second hand to squeeze the blade section together... the spring action is too tough I wish I went with my gut and just bought simple blunt preschool scissors. Also is a pain because there is a extra lip at the tip of the blade, not sure what the purpose is for this but its even awkward for me to use.
I expected this thread to be similar to the threading used for jeans. It is super thin and is basically regular sewing thread that is the color of jeans. That is all. It was strong enough not to break while repairing a pair of jeans but I wouldn't dare try to use this for hems or waistline repairs where the jean material overlaps.
Bought this for my lefty husband and he complains the finger opening is too small. So, guess it is fine for smaller hands but probably not for the medium to larger mens hands.
I bought a bunch of these rhinestone iron ons for my self and my bridesmaids. I did the bridesmaids shirts first and they all worked perfectly. This one however, some of the adhesive wasn't on the rhinestones when i opened the package therefor I was not able to iron them all on. I just wish it worked like the other ones I had bought. The rhinestones that did adhere stayed on though.
Received the student kit and decided to order the teacher version too. The student version is mostly about organics, lots of carbon and hydrogen. The teacher version has color coded parts for other atoms, like sulfur and phosphorus. We use it at our company to explain technical points about monomers in plastics. But plastics molecules can get big so I need more parts. I also take it home to explain things to the kids. They grasp things quickly in "3D", like chemistry "LEGOS" --more fun than flat drawings. Quick guide inside box illustrates many molecules you can build and the basic principles of nomenclature. Leaves you wanting more when you run out of parts. Impress your friends. Build a model of something common and keep it around for a while. Then try something else. They won't fall apart easily by themselves--which is cool. Modeling concepts become easy, however molecules snap togeter with some effort. Moderately hard to disassemble pieces, comes with a tool for prying the "close" bonds apart.
Or someone really unorganized. This book really had nothing to offer that you can't learn off an organization site. Total waste of money if you've been scrapping a while or have a magazine. They took a whole book to tell you the same things Creating Keepsakes did in a 3 page article. It really was not at all helpful to me and I ended up returning it.
I received this shipment with high hopes, being excited to start making leather jewelry. I almost cried when I opened the box. Great packaging, garbage inside. Hard as wood scraps of gray and brown leather (I think it was leather as it mostly resembled concrete coated fabric) that no one could use for anything. This company has incredible nerve to send out such awful stuff. It is almost as if I was paying them to take care of their garbage. It was so stiff i could not bend it with my hands, and there is no way it could be used for crafts...or anything. Mostly tiny pieces, ugly ugly.Buyer beware! Their stuff is the worst I have ever received.2-Lb Assorted Leather Scraps. Great for Crafts
pens; but they run out of ink so quickly. i need to find a pen just as good but cheaper.
I read a lot of different reviews, some from people who hated this machine, and others who sang its praises. It's not a completely fool-proof machine, and I've had a little trouble with the tension, but the manual that comes with the machine has a good trouble-shooting section that has helped a lot with that. It comes with several different presser feet that have been very useful, and several extra needles of various sizes, which was a welcome surprise. So far I've made a quilt, sewn buttons of all sizes, made some stuffed animals, fixed some seams and hems, and it's worked just fine. If you're a professional seamstress, this machine will not be good enough for you, but if you need something for home projects, this machine works just fine.
As many reviews have stated, this is a heavy material that would not work well if one wanted any kind of drape. The picture quality was excellent. I used it to print out old and current pictures of my family for a patchwork quilt that was a big hit. It would also be great for totes and aprons. Although I don't have kids, I could see this as a project they would really enjoy as well.
i near pounced on my brown santa when he brought my package (aka UPS guy), and boy am i happy. I've never sewed so this was a big investment for me. It's a great size, very pleasing to the eye and all the little accessories are cool, once i figure out what to do with them.For a complete beginner the instructions were horrible. The manual is for many brother products, so i didn't know which section to follow... (e.g do i have a fast wind bobbin? automatic needle threader thing? i had no idea...) and I'm still working out the thread tension. For beginners like me, take your time, read the thing over and over and play with it a while.The machine itself is great, I already made curtains for my bed and my athlete boyfriend gave it a try. For the price, it's really unbeatable...especially if you look at the price it originally retailed at.It's not too heavy which is great, and the lcd screen controls the stitch width and you can plug in what stitch you want. I went to Stitches on capitol hill (Seattle) and the owner had bought a whole bunch of this particular model for her customers to use. Guess it's a good sign.
they hurt my hand like crazy, it was sore for three days after i used them, they are sharp however,and make a clean cut. i would recommend the ones with the spring back.
If your ring has a stone that is delicate and sizing is a risk, or you aren't confident in your jeweler, or your ring can't be sized or you don't want the cost of sizing, or your finger size changes with weight gain and lose....these ring guards are a good alternative. Works for me...I don't notice the guards after I get used to them.
We bought this table and chairs for our 20 month old grandson for Christmas. It was a big hit. The bright colors are appealing. It is sturdy. He loves to put things away so the storage bins were a big plus. The chairs are strong enough to hold us adults so we can sit with him and join in on the coloring and playing. I would highly recommend this table and chairs.
I have just ventured into ink and marker drawings. This stuff is a miracle product, has saved several drawings which would have other wise been ruined with just a few brushstrokes.I am betting this one ounce jar will last me for years.
I send one back because brushes were broken. Brushes are broken on the second set also. Did not want to deal with sending it back again.
We use this tape to reinforce manila folders in my office. It means the folders last 3 time longer before needing replacement.
I bought this machine thinking it would be a good learning maching for my daughter. Out of the box it worked great for piecing a quilt. The straight stitch is nice and even, but when I tried to sew more than one layer of fabric, the tension was off and difficult to fix. The bobbin also kept nesting, regardless of adjusting the tension. I had rip out every line sewn on the layers and switch to my trusty old (hand me down from MY grandmother) Viking to finish.It's not a bad machine for the most basic stuff, but I won't be using it for quilting again.
Love this machine. Replaced a 10 year Brother that was still working. My only issue is that I find the stitch selecter screen hard to read. Have to focus my flashlight on it. Thought the screen was backlit.
You will still need either a good book or a friend to help you figure out how to hold the pen and make the letters. This is just a kit w/ paper and pens and the pens weren't even that great. No matter how you write they don't make lines that transition between fat and thin. Might as well use a regular pen...I am kinda dissapointed and will keep looking for better pens.I give it 2 stars for dollar value.
We were looking for a lightweight but fairly-capable machine to replace an old, heavy "portable". This Brother has a wide range of stitches, a needle threader, free-arm capability for sewing circular items and will sew several layers of fabric. This puts it a notch above some of the real cheap entry level machines. Some of the pieces, like the plastic panel over the bobbin, seem flimsy, but it should be OK if handled with proper care. The included case is really just a vinyl cover with a couple of pockets. You reach through the cover to grab the machine and carry it by its handle. All in all, I think it will work fine for our occasional mending, or a beginning machine etc. If you are seriously into sewing, you may want to go to check out some heavier-duty models.
This tape does not work very well! I had a hard time getting it to melt unless I was willing to hold the iron on so long that it burned the fabric. I am going to throw it out and go to Ikea and buy some of their curtain hemming tape, which works MUCH better than this!
This idea is great. But the utensils were cheap, like seriously the sponge would wipe away the paint, the thin plastic pan the paint was in was so delicate we had to work slow as to not break it in half, and the brush was a joke as the bristles brushed off in less than 5 strokes. We had to use my professional paint brushes that I had stored away in boxes in the back of our closet. The 8 paint colors had a nice thick consistency when mixed properly but we really had to layer it on to get a vibrant picture without it fading before we actually got to take a snapshot of it. We got two fading pictures out of it, but that was with he help of 6 watercolors from target, almost a month of frustration, and the ridiculous amount of time we had to spare. I gave birth soon after the second picture, with paint still left over which I guess we'll save for him to paint with but pfth I'd rather get him real hand paint.I'm glad I came across this idea, but the $2 water colors and a $2 face painting kit from a $.99 & up store would have produced the same results.Steal the idea, don't waste the money. ** stars for the two pictures, thats all.
This product worked fine for the first 20 lights then the next 10 lights you have to flick the lighter at least 15 times to finally get it to ignite. It gets worse and worse as far as flicks to get it to light. I just got off my deck and I counted 20 flicks and finally it lit. The butane level is almost 3/4 full and still I have no idea why it still won't light. I will be returning this product as soon as possible. I thought paying this price would give me a reliable lighter on the golf course and in heavy winds but all it has brought to me is frustration and dismay. I hate this lighter with every ounce of being that I contain and everything it stands for. Give me my Ronson or Bic and this lighter can rot in hell!
I've used a different tape measure for my waist for years, and it recently broke. I picked this one up, and though it works, it seemed to stretch a little bit too much and might be better served for regular measuring as opposed to my weekly bf measurements.
The ink pads had no ink the ink pads are all dried all out what good are stamps with no ink
I thought I had found the perfect little scissors for my left-handed 4-year old granddaughter. Good size, nice grip, colorful, blunt. But no! Not true left hand scissors. I am angry enough to return these.
Unable to close the pins, is of poor quality material, 3 of 6 nozzles were damaged, and no good, I lost my money with this tool.
The rebate forms clearly state that they cannot be duplicated (i.e. reproductions won't be accepted). Since Amazon's chosen method of giving out the rebate forms is to let you print them yourself, that means you will be sending in a reproduction. I asked Amazon if they had discussed this with the manufacturer, and whether the manufacturer had agreed to accept the reproductions for purchases on Amazon. Amazon never contacted them, even after they received my request for information, and (at least at the time of this writing) they continue to advertise the rebates that will probably not be honored.
it did not cut like i thought it would, their was a review that said it cut through a thin tin container so i figured it could cut through three thickness's of material it doesn't now i still have to find something else
I have been sewing for many, many, many years and always with Singer Machines.Based on reviews and price i decided to give this machine a try.It was wonderful at first, but to take apart for cleaning and oiling simply takes too much time away from my sewing projects.Plus the screwdriver supplied is so tall it would not fit under the arm, had to use my singer one.I am in the process of finding out how to return.
We did a big service project of repairing the broken hymnbooks in our church. There were over 100 books, and we were teaching ourselves, so we tried this book tape and then clear shipping/packaging tape. They were basically the same. We didn't like them because the clear tape made the books look cheap. But the real problem was that as we followed online instructions on how to repair the broken and torn backs, we found that although this tape is heavy, it tears easily. Many of the covers were torn in the top where the spine meets the front and back. And this tape gave no strength for this repair.We eventually found a book binding tape made of vinyl coated cloth that works perfectly. It is strong and looks great on the books. We found it here:[...]We have no agreement with Demco and they are not compensating us in any way. I would just like to save anyone else from all the trial and error we went through before we found something that works.
We were so disappointed when we received this item, which was to be a Santa present for my two year old grandchildren. The center arrived with a side missing the groove to support the base, which meant we could not assemble it. We had to take it to a carpenter who had a special saw which could cut the groove.Not something which could easily be done one day before Christmas. And no-one has responded to my report of this manufacturing error. I guess no-one will acknowledge this comment either.Shirley
I had to punch several times to get the whole made. The puncher slipped out of position several times. It appeared to be unstable on the garment and moved before I could punch my belt.
This might be okay if you're punching thin paper, one sheet at a time, but when I tried heavier paper the plastc - yes, plastic! - handle snapped right off. Maybe mine had a defect, or a weak section, but without a metal core the plastic will eventually weaken and break. Not at all worth the money, I will never buy one like this again.
I like the quality of the paper for colored pencils art drawings. The weight of the paper is good, but would recommend exploring other products.
This tape pen needs another round of testing by the manufacturer. I was fighting with this thing through my whole project. What happens is the used tape doesn't retract into the pen so you're constantly winding it. What a pain.
A simple tool. Easy to adjust. Bought it to punch additional holes in my belts. Works perfectly.
They say it's clear paper but it's more like a frosted clear paper, so when you put it on something you either have to cut right along what you printed or if you do something that you wanted on a clear sheet it looks frosted and doesn't really look good at all.Shame they say it goes on clear when it doesn't.
As a teacher, I spend an inordinate amount of time putting posters on my classroom walls to inspire and instruct my students. Too many of the products sold for this purpose have proved ... well, "inadequate" would be kind. Coming in each morning to find another poster (or several) on the floor is not the best way to begin the day.This year, I decided to try some alternatives to the usual types. Quakehold! 88111 Museum Putty is just fantastic. Once up, what it holds stays up. I even subjected it to a severe test - I am using it to hold a framed poster on a paper covered bulletin board. It has not budged a millimeter.
Yes, every once in awhile the pen stops working, and I need to screw in the piston a little more. Ink has a nice feel when writing with it, so I am not entirely disappointed with it.
T his looks great in our sons nursery and it will match the Kidkraft boat bed we purchased well! all in all well worth the money and a must have for a nursery/toddler's room!
well like the title says the glue gun gets the job done but I just hate that the chord is like the length of a ruler T_T thats way to short for me...
I'm not much into painting, therefore the numbers mean nothing to me....I ordered these for my child thinking that as the picture shows, there are 12 different sized brushes, and would make her paint by number picture easier to paint. Instead I received 12 of the same size brushes, thick therefore useful in most paint by number projects.
I received this machine as a birthday gift last year as a beginner machine. After spending 30 minutes trying to locate the front loading bobbin (thank god for the internet) I finally had it threaded. After my first simple project was completed (a pillow case) this machine has unthreaded the needle countless times, sucked the material inside the machine twice, and the foot pedal only has one speed, WARP SPEED. It gets 2 stars because it is ever so slightly still more convenient than hand stitching but not by much.
My 6 year-old daughter received this as a Christmas gift and was very excited about using it. We quickly realized that it was too complicated for her. Even with an adult using it, the machine jammed up on the second use. My husband was able to get it unjammed and it immediately jammed up again. After several repetitions of this, I found myself wishing it had come with a receipt. I would most certainly not spend $40 on this machine.
I am completely new to the sewing practice. I purchased this machine after reading the other reviews, and I am happy I did it.I was not looking for anything fancy, only a machine to do simple beginner tasks, and I find this one very easy to use. I completed my first project in one afternoon.By the way, the included instruction book is written in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. I am a native Spanish speaker, so the fact that my language is included in the manual was very useful.
Prismacolors are nice markers. They aren't the BEST, but they certainly are good for beginners and novices. They are nicely blendable, come in an array of colors, and are double-tipped. They are shaped nicely too, so they are easy to control.The downsides are as followed:1. They tend to bleed a little.2. This set comes with an unbalanced array of colors. There is 1 red, 5 shades of pink, 3 oranges, about 14 skin tones, 3 yellow, 7 shades of green, 2 very distinctly different purples, and 8 blues. It also comes with 2 metallic and 1 black. The others are colors inbetween. This set is best for drawing human figures. The first two rows of the tray are various skin tones. There are no grays nor whites.3. The tray isn't all that great. Assembly is a bit confusing, and it doesn't stay together as well as it could.In conclusion, these markers are very nice, although this set should be used soley for drawing bodies or even fashion design. The tray is not worth much more than $5, so if you aren't pressed for space and absolutely need it, buy the set without the tray. It's much cheaper and still worth it.
i purchased this rolls to cover the tables for my step-sons bday party. i put crayons in a cute vase for the kids to see the wide variety of colored crayons, and they colored the tables while between games, eating, etc.over it all there was lots left to use for another baby shower which will be coming up for my sister, this roll has lots of utilizing and i will be using it to the very end.fash shipping will purchase more before i run out, for sure!
Red Heart Super Saver Yarn is a pretty great bargain. Michael's sells it for about $2.99 (I doubt it's much different at other large brand craft stores) and as you can clearly see, you get a lot for a little and there are a good deal of colors to choose from. The yarn itself is 100% acrylic - part of the reason it's so inexpensive. To some, this can be a serious drawback. Many people dislike the somewhat scratchy feel of it, and I can't blame them. It's not the softest yarn in the bunch, but who can be surprised with such a nice price? I would not recommend this yarn to use for sweaters or other clothing items. Unless you're making it for yourself and don't mind the somewhat scratchiness. (Note: a single wash can help ease the scratchiness.) Another thing to note is many people are "yarn sensitive" and acrylic can bother the skin. In which case, I'd look for cotton and other natural fiber yarns. But on the flip side, Red Heart Super Saver is perfect for stuffed animals, dolls, and amigurumi of that sort. It's durable, especially when you figure that you won't be throwing your amigurumi in the wash that often. I find it easy to work with, especially because it's a tight yarn and stuffed toys generally benefit from Red Heart's tightness. Unless you're making a stuffed toy for a baby to snuggle with, it's great for children's toys. And, who can forget the price! A few other drawbacks, though minor, I noted are that I tend to find a couple superficial tangles in the skeins that annoy but do not ruin the whole thing. Also, I occasionally pick up a skein that just doesn't work the way I'd like it to. For example, I bought a skein of the skin colored one and found that it just didn't work like the other skins of RHSS did. I guess there are lemons in every product, but still a bit annoying.Overall...PROS:- Excellent price- Large color palette, including some unique multicolored options- Widespread availability- Good for making stuffed toys/amigurumi- Easy to work with for many- Lot of yarn included- Durable sans the washing machineCONS:- Scratchy (though one wash can help soften it up)- Acrylic (only a con for some)- Splices a little easier than other yarns (I repeat, you get what you pay for!!)- Wears after a couple washes- Occasional little tangles in the skein- Some skeins are lemonsOverall, I recommend this yarn for someone who would like to use it for toys, not garments. Blankets and large afghans, I think it would work for that too as long as it wasn't designed to be soft or sensitive on the skin.
I'm a beginner so I wanted something easy to use, and I found it!I was working on an old machine that was so difficult, but this is simple to use machine is great. Direction are easy to use and sews beautiful. The only down point is that it isn't very quite, however, compared to some of the other's i've used, this is somewhat common. I would really recommend this to anyone. Its cheap to!
COMPLETES MY COLLECTION NO NEED TO STOP A PROJECT IN THE MIDDLE TO GO BUY NEEDLES. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I KNIT ALL NIGHT AND NO CRAFT SHOPS ARE OPEN AT THAT TIME.
The product detail leads you to believe you are getting three booklets, when you are only getting one. The other two are just one page instructions folded to look like a booklet. The main booklet is not like the original and is written in five or so languages surrounding the picture making both the instructions (in your language) harder to read and detail in the illustration harder to see. Go for the original Jon Gnagy Learn To Draw.
Product works as advertised so you would assume it is a good product but you know what they say about assuming. What is NOT advertised is that the punch heads sit in three separate tracks and you can only adjust the punch heads so much. I purchased this product to punch seven equidistance holes in my preprinted checks so the stubs could be held in a binder. Due to the products limitations, I can punch only five holes in the proper positions and have to manually punch single holes for the other two.If this product had a single track so the punch heads were fully adjustable I would have given it a five star rating.
