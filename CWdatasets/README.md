# COP509 Coursework Dataset: Government Inquiry Recommendations and Responses

This repository contains datasets for the **COP509: Natural Language Processing** coursework at Loughborough University.

## Overview

The dataset comprises pairs of publicly available UK government inquiry documents:
- **Recommendations**: Extracted recommendations from official government inquiry reports
- **Responses**: The government's official responses to those recommendations

These document pairs have been pre-processed and aligned to support NLP tasks such as document similarity analysis, information extraction, and recommendation-response matching.
